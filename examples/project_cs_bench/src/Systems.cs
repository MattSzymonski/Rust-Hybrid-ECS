// Managed component-iteration benchmark.
//
// Responsibilities
// - Fill the world with a fixed number of entities, set by PILL_BENCH_ENTITIES.
// - Time three query shapes that mirror `pill_engine`'s `query_iteration`
//   Criterion target, and print one parseable line per shape.
//
// Design
// The unit reported is nanoseconds per entity, because that is what makes the
// managed number comparable to the Rust one: Criterion times a tight in-process
// loop, while a managed system runs once per frame across the interop boundary.
// Amortised over a thousand entities or more, that per-frame transition is
// negligible per entity; below roughly a hundred it would dominate and the
// comparison would stop meaning anything, which is why the sweep starts at 1k.
//
// Only frames where the world already holds the full entity count are sampled,
// so the spawn frames - which do real allocation work - never enter a
// measurement. A warmup is skipped on top of that, to let the JIT settle.
//
// Each measured loop folds the values it reads into a sink that is written back
// to a static. Without that the loop body has no observable effect and the JIT
// is free to delete it, which would measure an empty iteration.
