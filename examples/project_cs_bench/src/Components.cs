// Components for the managed iteration benchmark.
//
// Responsibilities
// - Declare the three blittable component types the benchmark systems iterate.
//
// Design
// These are a deliberate, field-for-field mirror of the components in
// `modules/pill_engine/benches/query_iteration.rs`, because the whole point of
// this project is to put a managed number beside that Rust one. Same field
// count, same widths, same three-component population on every entity: an
// 8-byte Position, an 8-byte Velocity and a 4-byte Health. Getting this wrong
// is not a detail - a benchmark that moves fewer bytes per row than the one it
// is compared against reports a speed it did not earn.
