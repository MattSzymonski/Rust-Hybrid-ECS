//! The camera's follow target: an entity reference the Inspector can point.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declare [`FollowTarget`], a component whose field names another entity.
//! - Read that reference in a system, which is what makes it live data rather
//!   than a stored number the engine never uses.
//!
//! The component exists as the editor's test subject for entity references
//! (W-0048 Stage 6): it is the only field in the example that holds an
//! `Entity`, so a picture of the Inspector shows what a reference row draws.
