//! A pure simulation: no renderer, no assets, no window.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Fill the world with [`TICKER_COUNT`] tickers, each counting the frames it
//!   has lived through.
//! - Report the world's total once a second through the engine's log, the only
//!   output a headless run has.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! `renderer: none` in `project_settings.yaml` keeps the renderer's GPU module
//! and its data crate out of the load order. No device is opened and no
//! surface exists, so there is nothing to draw. What is left is the engine's
//! core - world, scheduler, hot reload - which is what a server-side or test
//! build runs.
//!
//! `init` fills the world up to a target count instead of spawning fresh
//! entities, because it runs again on every hot reload, against the live
//! world.
