// A pure simulation: tickers counting frames, reported through the engine log.
//
// Responsibilities
// - Define the ticker component and the report schedule resource.
// - Fill the world up to the target entity count.
// - Advance every ticker and log the world's total about once a second.
//
// Design
// The twin of `headless_rust`: `renderer: none` in `project_settings.yaml`
// keeps every renderer crate out of the load order, so a run opens no device.
// A managed startup runs once for the life of the host while the spawn system
// runs every frame, which is also what keeps a hot reload from duplicating the
// world - it creates only the entities that are missing.
//
// The report is on wall-clock time, not frames: a headless host has no vsync,
// so it runs the frame loop as fast as the machine allows and a frame-count
// interval would print thousands of lines a second.
