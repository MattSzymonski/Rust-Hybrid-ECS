// Managed mirror of examples/project_rs/src/lib.rs.
//
// Responsibilities
// - Runs the ball physics: five balls bouncing inside a fixed box.
// - Drives the project's single spline from the ball centres and keeps one
//   sample dot on the curve every SplineSampleStep of `t`.
// - Fills the world with those entities, up to a target count, the way the
//   Rust init does.
//
// Design
// The scene, the constants, the per-frame math and the shapes of the systems
// are the Rust project's - including the three-query `spline_path` pass - so
// both projects run the same demo against the same world. Three things cannot
// be expressed the same way on the managed side, and each is named where it
// matters:
// 1. `SimulationTime` is an engine resource here, as it is in Rust, reached
//    through `ResMut<T>`. The ball system stamps it before reading it rather
//    than a separate time system writing it, because the scheduler orders
//    systems by access and does not promise which of two disjoint ones runs
//    first - stamping where the value is used needs no such promise.
// 2. A startup cannot query, so filling the world up to a target count - which
//    the Rust init checks by counting entities - is done by the spawn systems:
//    they run every frame and create only what is missing, which is also what
//    keeps a hot reload from duplicating the scene.
// 3. Registration needs no code here: the loader discovers the attributed
//    systems and registers the project's components from the managed manifest,
//    where the Rust init calls `register_system` and `register_component`
//    itself.
