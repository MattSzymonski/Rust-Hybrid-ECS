//! Moves every pill through an animated curl noise field.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Sample the curl of a noise vector potential at each pill, pull the pill
//!   towards the middle of the field, damp and clamp its velocity, and keep it
//!   inside the field's box ([`curl_noise_system`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The field is Bridson, Hourihan and Nordenstam's curl noise ("Curl-Noise for
//! Procedural Fluid Flow", SIGGRAPH 2007). A vector potential Ψ is built from
//! three decorrelated noise fields, and the pills move along its curl ∇ × Ψ.
//! A curl has no divergence, so the flow never forms sinks and the pills swirl
//! instead of bunching up. Each pill depends only on its own state, so the
//! query runs in parallel.
