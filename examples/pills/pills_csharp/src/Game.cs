// `demo_control_system` becomes the system of the same name. Unlike the Rust
// project's `#[pill_project] fn init`, which runs again on every hot reload, a
// managed startup runs exactly once for the life of the host, so nothing here
// needs the "already built" guards the Rust version keeps.
//
// Asset loading goes through the asset store the renderer data crate mirrors
// to C#: `assets.Import<Mesh>`/`<Texture>` for the mesh and the map (whose
// `.meta` files this project ships, so they import under their own guids), and
// `assets.ImportStandalone<Material>` for the `.material` file, which is a
// standalone asset with no `.meta` of its own. A startup declares the resources
// it needs as parameters, like every system in this project.
