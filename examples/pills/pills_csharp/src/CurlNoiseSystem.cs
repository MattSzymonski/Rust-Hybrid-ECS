// Moves every pill through an animated curl noise field.

// Managed counterpart of examples/pills/pills_rust/src/curl_noise_system.rs,
// and the same algorithm: Bridson, Hourihan and Nordenstam's curl noise ("Curl
// Noise for Procedural Fluid Flow", SIGGRAPH 2007) - take a vector potential
// built from three decorrelated noise fields and move along its curl, which is
// divergence free, so the pills swirl instead of bunching into sinks.
//
// Like the Rust system, the row loop is a parallel pass: `ForEachParallel`
// dispatches it onto the host's shared pool (the runtime resolves the chunks
// on the frame thread first). The body runs on worker threads, so it touches
// only the two component references it is handed plus a snapshot of the
// tuning resource taken before the pass - no engine calls, no Commands.
