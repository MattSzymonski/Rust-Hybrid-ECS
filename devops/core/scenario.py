"""
The shared scenario runner for the host-driving suites.

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+

DESCRIPTION
    One definition of the loop every hot-reload suite runs: edit source files,
    wait for the reload, assert what the host printed, put the files back.

    The three suites that drive the host grew their own copy of it, and the
    copies drifted. Two of them captured their wait index per phase and one per
    scenario; two waited proof-of-life tokens from an index taken after the
    reload token and one from its settle token; the crash sweep, the
    required/forbidden sweep and the restore step were each written three
    times, with the messages disagreeing. One copy makes those choices one
    decision instead of three (audit SA-0057).

    A suite supplies what is genuinely its own:

      * `Scenario` / `ScenarioPhase` - its table of edits, tokens and waits.
      * `ScenarioRunner`              - its scaled timeouts, and the token its
                                        restores settle with.
      * `validators`                  - checks over a scenario's output that
                                        only that suite knows how to make
                                        (migrated entity counts, witnesses).

USAGE
  from core.scenario import Scenario, ScenarioPhase, ScenarioRunner, run_scenario

  with `devops/` on `sys.path`; see `core.paths.ensure_devops_on_path`.
