"""
Project and path configuration shared by every devops suite and gate step.

REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.8+ (standard library only).

DESCRIPTION
    One module names the projects the devops scripts drive and the files inside
    them the scripts read or edit. A suite imports a name; it does not spell a
    path of its own, so relocating, adding or renaming a project is an edit here
    and nowhere else under `devops/`.

    `EXAMPLES_ROOT` and `OFFICIAL_EXAMPLE_PROJECTS` name the projects a
    developer runs: the local checkout and the tracked official examples. The
    projects the suites drive live under `devops/tests/projects/` and are named
    by `TEST_PROJECTS_ROOT` / `TEST_PROJECT_NAMES`, so a clean checkout can run
    the gate without an examples checkout. The functional fixture crate derives
    from `TESTS_ROOT` as well.

    Each project is exported in two forms, because the callers need different
    ones:

      * `*_ROOT` - an absolute `Path` to the project directory, for reading and
        writing files;
      * `*_PATH` - the `PROJECT_PATH` value the host receives. The host resolves
        it against its working directory, which is the Cargo workspace
        (`modules/`), and accepts POSIX separators on every platform.

    A tool that resolves its own argument against the repository root (the
    shipping generator, the web build, a suite that writes a command line) takes
    `repository_relative(<root>)` instead of a `*_PATH` value.

USAGE
  from core.projects import NATIVE_PROJECT_ROOT, NATIVE_PROJECT_PATH

  With `devops/` on `sys.path`; see `core.paths.ensure_devops_on_path`. Suites
  that import `core.suite_common` receive every public name below through its
  star import.
