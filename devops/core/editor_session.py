"""One driver for the editor end-to-end suites.

RESPONSIBILITIES
  - EditorSession: one editor run for a suite - the machine-global host lock,
    the stray-editor cleanup under it, a per-run folder (log, command file,
    LOCALAPPDATA sandbox), the launch environment and the character-anchored
    log waits the editor suite is built on.
  - The shared editor log tokens (*_TOKEN) the suite waits on, as plain
    substrings, so `test_log_contract.py` checks each against the Rust
    sources that print it.

DESIGN
  The suite anchors waits on character offsets into a growing log file: an
  assertion captures `start = session.length()` before it sends a command and
  re-scans only what arrives after. `OutputMonitor` in `suite_common` is a
  pipe-based line monitor with token searches; it cannot serve an offset
  anchor over the whole stream without changing every assertion, so
  EditorSession owns a log FILE (the child's stdout lands in it) and
  re-reads it tolerantly, exactly as the suites did. The lock, the
  stray-process cleanup and the sandbox conventions come from
  `suite_common`; per-run folders keep every run's log instead of
  overwriting a fixed one.
