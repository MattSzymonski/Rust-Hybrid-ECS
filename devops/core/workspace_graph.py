"""
One reader for the Cargo manifests the architecture guards check.

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.11+ (`tomllib`)

DESCRIPTION
    Three guards used to carry their own manifest reader: the engine-layout
    guard resolved path dependencies by hand, the renderer-boundary guard
    expanded the workspace member globs itself, and the feature-drift guard
    read module manifests with a regex. One reader means one place that gets
    renamed packages, `[target.'cfg(...)'.*]` tables and workspace globs
    right.

    Used by:
      * `devops/tests/test_engine_layout.py`
      * `devops/tests/test_renderer_boundaries.py`
      * `devops/tests/test_engine_feature_drift.py`

    Everything here answers questions about the repository's manifests. None
    of the rule sets live here: each guard keeps its own constants and
    checks, and reads them through these primitives.

USAGE
  from core.workspace_graph import Crate, example_projects, workspace_members

  crate = Crate(MODULES / "pill_core" / "Cargo.toml")
  for dependency in crate.linked():
      print(dependency.package, dependency.kind, dependency.directory)
