"""Generate HTML or JSON documentation for this Cargo workspace.

Without flags, the script generates classic rustdoc HTML with stable
``cargo doc``. Passing ``--json`` switches to nightly rustdoc JSON generation
for downstream tools such as ``generate_documentation_markdown.py``.

Unlike ``cargo doc --workspace``, ``cargo rustdoc`` accepts the unstable JSON
output option but operates on only one selected package target at a time. JSON
mode therefore discovers workspace members, selects each documentation target,
and invokes nightly rustdoc once per target. HTML mode documents the workspace
in one Cargo command.

Rustdoc's JSON format is unstable, so JSON mode requires both a nightly
toolchain and Cargo's ``-Z unstable-options`` switch. HTML mode uses the normal
stable toolchain and produces directly browsable rustdoc pages.

Requirements:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rustup with the nightly toolchain installed

Usage:
  python devops/docs/generate_documentation.py
  python devops/docs/generate_documentation.py --json
  python devops/docs/generate_documentation.py --dry-run
  python devops/docs/generate_documentation.py --json --dry-run

Output:
  HTML: target/doc/index.html and crate subdirectories
  JSON: target/doc/<crate_name>.json
