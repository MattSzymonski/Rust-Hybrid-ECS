"""
Edit-during-build regression test for Rust-Hybrid-ECS.

PROTECTS: A save made during a build wins: the newer edit is the one built and loaded.
TIER: host
SETS: hot-reload

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rust toolchain (cargo)

DESCRIPTION
    Pins the one thing every other hot-reload suite misses: what happens to a
    save that lands WHILE a rebuild triggered by the previous save is running.

    The host watches a generation counter. A save bumps it; the frame loop
    reloads when it differs from the last processed value. `run_build_command`
    polls the same counter mid-build and aborts the moment it advances, so that
    a newer save wins instead of the process adopting code the developer has
    already replaced.

    That cancellation is only useful if the newer save is then built. The
    bookkeeping has to record the generation the reload STARTED from, not a
    fresh read taken after it finished - a fresh read includes the save that
    caused the cancellation and marks it as handled, so nothing ever builds it.
    The edit then sits on disk, never compiled, with no error printed anywhere,
    until something unrelated happens to touch the crate again.

    Every other suite makes one edit and waits, so none of them can see this.
    This one saves twice, the second inside the build window, and requires both
    halves of the story: the host cancelled the in-flight build for the second
    save, AND the newer sources were then built. A rebuild that arrives without
    the cancellation means the second save missed the window - the suite's whole
    subject never happened - so that is a miss to retry with an earlier save,
    not a pass. The retry places its save from the window the missed build
    measured, because a machine whose builds are three times slower moves it.
    Both attempts wait for the host to stop logging first: a save made while
    another build is in flight reloads late, because both builds share cargo's
    lock, and the window this suite measures would not be the one it saved into.

USAGE
  python devops/tests/test_reload_edit_during_build.py [--timeout-scale S]
      [--skip-build] [--second-edit-delay S]

  `--second-edit-delay` is an upper bound: a retry derives its delay from the
  build it measured.

EXAMPLE USAGE
  python devops/tests/test_reload_edit_during_build.py
  python devops/tests/test_reload_edit_during_build.py --second-edit-delay 0.4

# `rendering` resolves a different variant than the project does - and Windows
# keeps one module of a given name per process, so the project DLL loads
# against the host's copy and fails with "The specified procedure could not be
