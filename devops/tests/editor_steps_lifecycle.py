"""The editor suite's lifecycle steps: restart, recovery, cadence, posture, panels.

Each function here is one step area of `test_editor_egui.py` that runs after
the suite's main session has closed: it opens its own sessions on the same
binary and project, and asserts on their logs exactly as the earlier steps do.
The suite's `main` keeps the parser, the preflight, the main session and the
`finally` restore, and calls `run_lifecycle_steps` once.

The step bodies are moved verbatim; their names (log patterns, tokens and the
`wait_for_token` helper) are imported from the suite, because those constants
are one vocabulary shared with the steps that stay in `main`.
