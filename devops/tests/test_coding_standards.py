Pill comment and layout lint for the Rust, shader, managed and devops sources.

PROTECTS: Every .rs file follows the Pill comment and layout rules.
TIER: static

REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.8+ (standard library only).

DESCRIPTION
    Lints every `.rs` file under the repository against the Pill comment and
    layout rules (see the Pill Guide, "Contributing / Coding standards"), and
    holds shader sources and the managed and devops comment trees to the same
    comment-content ban. The checks are line-oriented heuristics, so they are
    a fast first-pass signal, not a substitute for a full per-file audit.

    Deliberate exemptions are listed beside the rule they weaken.

    The checks are the eleven `section()` titles `main()` prints, in run
    order: module headers, safety comments, public docs, import groups, tests
    placement, egui state, colour literals, comment content (Rust, managed and
    devops), shell patch openings, shader comment content and shell re-export
    blocks. That list is the single source; this header does not repeat it.

    The two window sizes are tunable through the environment:
    `SAFETY_WINDOW_LINES` (default 30) and `DOC_WINDOW_LINES` (default 12).

USAGE
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py [--root <path>] [--list]
                                              [--self-test] [--report <path>]
                                              [--exclude <path>]...
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py <path/to/file.rs | path/to/dir> ...

EXAMPLE USAGE
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py --list
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py --self-test
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py --root modules/engine/pill_engine/src
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py modules/engine/pill_core/src/lib.rs
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py modules/engine/pill_core/src/lib.rs \
      examples/project_rs/src/lib.rs --report local/lint.json
  python devops/tests/test_coding_standards.py --root modules \
      --exclude modules/extensions/pill_master_renderer

  Exit status: 0 when every checked file complies, 1 when at least one
  violation is reported, 2 on a usage error.
