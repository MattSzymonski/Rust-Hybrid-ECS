"""
A manager's settings asset is created, applied and re-applied live.

PROTECTS: A project with no settings asset gets one written from the manager's own document defaults, an edit reaches the running manager with no reload, and a refused document changes nothing.
TIER: host

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rust toolchain (cargo)

DESCRIPTION
    A manager is a resource that owns a subsystem. It declares a settings
    asset - a standalone asset type whose document is its own tunable shape -
    and the development host keeps `res/settings/<settings_name>.<extension>` in
    step with it: created from the document defaults when missing, applied after
    the project loads, and re-applied when the file's bytes change.

    The fixture project carries the subject for this
    (`devops/tests/projects/native/src/settings_probe.rs`): a manager with three
    knobs whose applier prints what it was asked to apply. One host run covers
    the four behaviours:

      1. created - the project starts with no `res/settings` directory. The host
         logs `created the manager settings asset` and writes an asset file
         holding the manager's whole default document, and the manager reports
         the defaults.
      2. live - editing a value in that file re-applies it with
         `changed=true`, the manager reports the new value, and no project
         rebuild happens: the run's reload line never follows the edit.
      3. kept across a reload - a source edit reloads the project, and the
         regenerated manager takes the document again, so the edited value is
         still in effect afterwards.
      4. refused - a document with a value the manager cannot use is refused by
         the manager and by the host, and the manager keeps what it had.

    The `res/settings` directory the suite caused is removed again, so the
    fixture is left byte-identical.
