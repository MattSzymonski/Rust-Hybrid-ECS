"""
Engine layout check: the rules that keep the engine core shared and the
`pill_engine` facade per DLL, read from the Cargo manifests and the core's
sources.

PROTECTS: The engine core never links the facade or reads a registry; shared dylibs stay UI-free.
TIER: static

REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.11+ (standard library only).

DESCRIPTION
    The engine is two crates. `pill_engine_core` holds the engine; `pill_engine`
    is the facade every project and extension depends on, which re-exports the
    core and owns the per-DLL `inventory` registries. The facade only works if
    every DLL embeds its own copy of it, so it must never end up inside the
    core: rustc links each crate once, and a crate the core depends on is the
    core's copy for every DLL. This check enforces:

      1. core graph   - nothing `pill_engine_core` links (its normal, build and
                        target-specific dependencies, followed through every
                        path dependency) is `pill_engine`.
      2. no registry  - the core reads no `inventory` registry: it has no
                        linked `inventory` dependency, and no source line under
                        `pill_engine_core/src` names `inventory::` outside a
                        comment. Once the core is shared, a registry read from
                        it would see every DLL's entries.
      3. no module-abi - the removed `module-abi` feature is not named anywhere
                        under `modules/` (manifests, sources; generated
                        members excluded). It was the marker for the in-crate
                        loadable artifact; the generated `host_module_*`
                        wrappers replaced it, and a build that turned it back
                        on would duplicate the entry-point symbols.
      4. shared UI    - each UI-independent shared dylib (`pill_ui_frame`, the in-game
                        egui UI's `pill_project_ui`, and the egui editor's copy,
                        `pill_editor_core`) is built as a
                        `dylib` (one copy per process) and links no UI framework,
                        window system or GPU crate (`dioxus`, `tao`, `wry`,
                        `winit`, `wgpu`), followed through every path dependency.
      5. shared core  - the shared `pill_core` dylib names no development-host
                        crate (`notify`, `libloading`, `walkdir`, `filetime`):
                        none is in its library graph, and no source line under
                        `pill_core/src` names one outside a comment. Every
                        posture links the core, so a crate only the development
                        host and the C# bridge reach must not sit inside it
                        (W-0114).
      6. UI kit       - `pill_ui_kit` is an rlib for exactly the two UI
                        dylibs, `pill_editor_core` and `pill_project_ui`: each
                        embeds the translator and re-exports it. Any other
                        manifest naming it would compile a third copy into a
                        link unit that owns no UI.
      7. staged dylibs - the development host's `ENGINE_DYLIB_STEMS` names
                        every shared dylib and nothing else. The host stages
                        those beside a module it isolates; one left out
                        resolves from the host's own directory instead, and a
                        module built from a different feature set then cannot
                        import it.
