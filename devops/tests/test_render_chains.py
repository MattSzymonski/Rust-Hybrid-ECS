"""
A committed .pipeline runs the frame a windowed build renders.

PROTECTS: The example's .pipeline loads by path and the renderer records its pass in the frame chain with a positive draw count.
TIER: host

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rust toolchain (cargo) and a display: the chain is only built with a
    surface, so this drives the windowed development host.

DESCRIPTION
    `examples/project_rs` ships `res/pipelines/main.pipeline`, which names the
    project's own `dwdw.render_pass` by guid, and its `init` imports both and
    hands the chain to `RenderingManager`. A chain is only built when a surface
    exists, so the suite launches the windowed development host on that project
    and reads the renderer's observation line:

        Pass chain: <pass label>(<draws>) ...

    The line is printed once per change. The suite requires a line whose only
    entry is the project's pass with a positive draw count: that is the chain
    the file describes actually running, and it cannot come from the built-in
    default chain, whose passes carry the data crate's names.

    Nothing is edited; the host is terminated on every path. The project's DLL
    is rebuilt by the host itself when it is stale.

USAGE

EXAMPLE USAGE
