"""
Engine feature drift check: every build the development hosts run resolves the
engine dylibs' dependency trees exactly as the host does.

PROTECTS: Every build the host spawns resolves the same engine features as the host itself.
TIER: static

REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.8+, cargo on PATH (runs `cargo tree --offline`).

DESCRIPTION
    `pill_core.dll` and `pill_engine_core.dll` are loaded once per process and
    imported by the host, every module and the project. The names they export
    hash the features their dependency tree resolved with, so a module whose
    build resolved one crate in that tree with a different feature set imports
    names the host's copy does not export, and fails to load with "procedure
    could not be found".

    For each host posture (headless `pill_standalone` with and without
    `hot_patch`, windowed `pill_standalone`, the native editor, the egui
    editor), this resolves each shared dylib's subtree for the host alone,
    then for every build a host spawns for a project: each extension's module
    build - the crate selected directly with the feature set its generated
    `host_module_<name>` wrapper would enable - the project's own build, and
    the project's startup batch, each plus the engine features
    `build_runner::host_engine_features` mirrors from the running host. Any
    crate whose features differ from the host's own resolution is reported.
    A posture is measured only against the dylibs it loads: the two editors
    skip each other's editor parts (`editor_frontend`), so one family's
    dylibs never reach the other's process.

    What is measured comes from tracked sources only - the extension crates by
    their `extensions/<folder>/<crate>` convention, the projects from their
    `project_settings.yaml` and manifests - never from the generated
    `host_module_*` / `host_project_*` crates the host leaves behind, which are
    gitignored and pruned between runs. A fresh clone and a used checkout
    therefore measure the same builds, and the count is printed so a drop is
    visible.

    Both editors are ordinary native frontends: they receive their engine
    features explicitly, exactly like the standalone builders, because nothing
    in their graph unions host-side macro features the way the retired dioxus
    editor's macros did. The host keeps the anchor machinery for that retired
    posture (`build_runner::apply_cargo_host_overrides`), but no frontend
    reaches it.

    Extensions are found by convention (every `extensions/<folder>/<crate>`
    crate); the projects are every example with both a `project_settings.yaml`
    and a `Cargo.toml`.

USAGE
  python devops/tests/test_engine_feature_drift.py [--verbose]
    --verbose  list the builds behind each reported difference

EXAMPLE USAGE
  python devops/tests/test_engine_feature_drift.py

  Exit status: 0 when no build drifts, 1 when one does, 2 when cargo tree fails.
