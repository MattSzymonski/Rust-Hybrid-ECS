"""
Full Hot-Reloading Integration Suite for Rust-Hybrid-ECS.

PROTECTS: Project and module hot reload keep data, migrate schemas, cascade and stay stable.
TIER: host
SETS: hot-reload, nightly-allowed-to-fail

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rust toolchain (cargo) on PATH
  - Run from the repository root or anywhere (paths are resolved from __file__)

DESCRIPTION
    End-to-end hot-reload suite that launches the standalone host and drives
    real source edits against the live project and an extension, then
    asserts the host's behaviour from its console output:

      Session A (project = devops/tests/projects/native, module = pill_spline)
        1. project_hot_reload      - editing the project triggers a reload and
                                     the counter system keeps ticking (data
                                     survives).
        2. schema_migration        - adding a field to a persistable component
                                     runs selective migration, data survives.
        3. project_forgotten_type  - a component the project stops registering
                                     emits the orphaned-data warning and names
                                     the type.
        4. module_hot_reload       - editing an extension reloads it and
                                     its persistable data survives (existing=1).
        5. module_double_reload    - two consecutive same-config reloads stay
                                     stable: the module re-seeds nothing
                                     (existing stays 1), pinning per-artifact
                                     TypeId stability (no per-reload growth).
        6. module_forgotten_type   - a module that stops registering a type
                                     emits the orphaned-data warning and names
                                     the type. Its data survives, because the
                                     project links the same crate and still
                                     claims that shared type - the peer rule
                                     `unclaimed_type_names` documents.
        7. module_forgotten_type_drop
                                   - the same warning for a module nothing
                                     else links, where the orphaned column is
                                     then dropped: the restored generation
                                     finds no data and re-seeds from scratch
                                     (existing=0), pinning drop-at-detection
                                     end-to-end.
        8. init_failure_rollback   - an init that returns non-zero keeps the
                                     previous generation and the host alive.

      Session B (project = devops/tests/projects/native, module = pill_spline)
        9. cascade_reload          - editing a module the project links triggers
                                     the module reload AND a project reload, and
                                     the new value reaches the running project
                                     (probe midpoint changes). The project probe
                                     still sees exactly ONE spline (xxsees 1),
                                     proving the project's embedded copy and the
                                     module's own copy coexist as distinct types.

    Every file the suite touches (project_settings.yaml files, module/project
    sources) is
    backed up at startup and restored afterwards, so a normal developer
    workspace is left exactly as it was.
