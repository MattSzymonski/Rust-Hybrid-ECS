"""
The three hot-reload switches each stop exactly the watches they name.

PROTECTS: `PILL_HOT_RELOADING`, `PILL_FUNCTION_HOT_PATCHING` and `PILL_ASSETS_HOT_RELOADING` each switch off one watch, in a real host, without stopping the project.
TIER: host

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rust toolchain (cargo); the host is built once and launched four times.

DESCRIPTION
    The development host reads three environment switches once, at startup, and
    reports them in one line. This suite starts the host four times against
    `devops/tests/projects/native` - once per posture, because a value read once
    cannot be changed in a running host - and reads the log each time:

      1. defaults - the switch line reports all three on, the project's assets
         are watched, and the source watchers started for every module.
      2. `PILL_HOT_RELOADING=0` - an edit to the project's
         `src/simulation_time.rs` is never noticed: no `hot reload triggered`
         appears while the project's own systems keep printing.
      3. `PILL_FUNCTION_HOT_PATCHING=0` - a body edit in the `#[pill_hot]`
         system reloads the module (`building project module`, then
         `hot reload complete`) instead of installing a patch, and the host
         says once that patching is off.
      4. `PILL_ASSETS_HOT_RELOADING=0` - the asset watcher never starts, the
         host says so, and an edit under the project's `res` produces no
         `[assets] reimported`.

    Every absence is asserted only after the host has been seen running, so a
    host that died cannot pass by saying nothing. Every edited file is restored
    byte for byte, and the host is stopped on every path, including a failure.
