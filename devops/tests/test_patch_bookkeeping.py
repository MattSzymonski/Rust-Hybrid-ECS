"""
Patch bookkeeping survival test for Rust-Hybrid-ECS.

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rust toolchain (cargo)

DESCRIPTION
    Pins the order between a project reload and the patch bookkeeping it
    invalidates: the records may only be dropped once the image they point
    into has actually been replaced.

    A reload attempt that fails - build error, load refusal, rolled-back init -
    keeps the current image running, and with it every live patch installed in
    it. Dropping the patch records on the attempt rather than on the outcome
    made the session misreport what is running: `list` stops naming the live
    generation, a rollback of the still-installed patch refuses with "has not
    been patched in this session", and the developer loses the way back
    through the history until the function is patched again.

    The scenario is three saves and one request:

      1. A body-only edit to an annotated project system, delivered by the
         per-function fast path. The host reports `[hot] ... LIVE ...` with
         the generation number.
      2. A structural edit that breaks the project build, so the reload that
         picks it up fails and keeps the current image. The host reports
         `build failed; keeping the old project module`.
      3. A rollback request for the function patched in step 1, while that
         failed reload's image is still the one running. The rollback must
         succeed (the patch is still installed and its records still name it);
         before the fix it refused because the failed attempt had already
         dropped the bookkeeping.

    The build failure is a deliberately unparseable tail appended to the same
    file, so no fast path can touch it and the reload path is the only one
    that runs.
