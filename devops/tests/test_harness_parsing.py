Unit tests for the test harness itself.

PROTECTS: The parsing the end-to-end suites decide pass or fail with, on real host output.
TIER: static
SETS: hot-reload

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - No Rust toolchain, no host process, no .NET. Runs in well under a second.

DESCRIPTION
    Tests the parsing logic the other suites depend on, against real captured
    output rather than invented strings.

    Every other suite in this directory is an end-to-end test: it launches a
    host, edits real sources, and decides pass or fail by matching strings in
    console output. That makes the matching logic load-bearing - and its failure
    mode is silence. A regex that stops matching does not raise; it returns
    nothing, and the suite reports "no reload detected" or quietly drops a
    measurement. The suite still exits 0 or 1, so nothing looks broken.

    That is not hypothetical. `RELOAD_LINE_RE` matched the reloaded function's
    name with `\\S+`, which silently dropped every line whose name contained a
    space or a comma:

        pill_spline::<Spline as ColorTweak>::tweak                   trait method
        pill_dummy_color::get_color_a, pill_dummy_color::Tint::mix   two bodies, one save

    Three of 128 real analytics lines were unparseable. The benchmark reported
    those reloads with no phase breakdown at all, which is indistinguishable
    from the C# category that legitimately has none.

    So these tests use REAL input, copied verbatim from host output and Rust
    source, as fixtures. Invented strings would keep passing while the gap
    between what the host prints and what the scanner expects widens.

    The checks cover the patch-coverage scanner, the shared edit/restore
    helpers and the editor session. The analytics-line parsing checks moved
    with their harness into the untracked `local/devops/` tree; nothing in this
    repository reads that harness, so those checks live beside it.

    The shared-slot rule used to be reimplemented in the test and then asserted
    against itself, so it could not fail when the engine changed. It now reads
    the rule out of `pill_development_host/src/build_runner.rs` and compares it
    with the names Cargo produces.
