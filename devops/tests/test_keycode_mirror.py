"""
Key code mirror check: the managed `KeyCode` enum against the engine's
`key_codes!` table, which the two halves only ever tied together with a comment.

PROTECTS: The C# KeyCode mirror names the same keys in the same order as the engine table.
TIER: static

REQUIREMENTS: Python 3.11+ (standard library only).

DESCRIPTION
    `pill_engine_core::input::KeyCode` is built by the `key_codes!` macro from
    one table, and its discriminant is what crosses the input ABI - the managed
    side receives a key as that number. `pill_csharp_runtime/src/KeyCode.cs`
    restates the table with explicit numbers, because C# cannot read the Rust
    macro. Until now the only coupling was a comment asking the two to be kept
    in step, so a key inserted mid-table on one side silently shifted every key
    after it: `KeyHeld(KeyCode.W)` would report another key, and nothing would
    say so.

    This check parses both tables and enforces three things:

      1. same keys   - the mirror declares exactly the engine's key names.
      2. same order  - the names appear in the table's declaration order, which
                        is what makes a discriminant mean the same key on both
                        sides.
      3. numbers     - each member's explicit number is its position, so a
                        hand-edited number is caught even when the names and
                        their order still agree.

    A fourth rule pins that the mirror is an enum over `byte`: the ABI carries
    a key in one byte, and a table that outgrew 256 keys would need the slot
    widened on both sides.

USAGE
  python devops/tests/test_keycode_mirror.py [--root <repository>]
  python devops/tests/test_keycode_mirror.py --self-test

EXAMPLE USAGE
  python devops/tests/test_keycode_mirror.py
  python devops/tests/test_keycode_mirror.py --self-test

  Exit status: 0 when every rule holds, 1 when at least one is broken, 2 on a
  usage error.
