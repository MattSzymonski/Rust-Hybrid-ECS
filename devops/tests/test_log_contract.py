"""
Guards the host log strings that the end-to-end suites match on.

PROTECTS: Every host log token a suite waits for still exists in the Rust sources.
TIER: static
SETS: hot-reload

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - No Rust toolchain, no host process, no .NET. Reads the Rust sources, so a
    run takes a few seconds.

DESCRIPTION
    Every end-to-end suite in this directory decides pass or fail by searching
    host console output for a literal token, declared as a `*_TOKEN` constant.
    Those constants make the host's log text an interface - but nothing on the
    Rust side says so, so a refactor that rewords a log line breaks the suites
    with no compiler error and no unit-test failure.

    That is not hypothetical. Unifying the project and extension reload
    paths behind one `ReloadTransaction` collapsed three distinct messages:

        "hot reload complete"                  also emitted by modules now
        "no longer registered by the project"  became "...by this module"
        "schema unchanged for all persistable component types"
                                               became "...persistable module types"

    The full workspace test suite stayed green at 412 passed. Only launching a
    host would have caught it, minutes into a run, as a confusing "no reload
    detected".

    This test closes that gap statically. It collects every `*_TOKEN` literal
    the suites define and requires each one to be printable by a Rust string
    literal: verbatim, or through the `{...}` placeholders a format string
    carries, since most host lines are built at runtime:

        "[analytics] reload pill_spline "  <-  "{} reload {} {} | build={} ..."

    A placeholder stands for one or more non-whitespace characters, and a token
    may stop in the middle of the literal, because a suite normally waits for
    the prefix it cares about and the host appends fields it does not. A match
    must carry MINIMUM_ANCHOR_CHARACTERS of static text, so that a template the
    log layer applies to every line - a formatter's `[{level}] {location}
    {message}` - cannot vacuously cover a token it has nothing to do with.

    A token no literal can print must be listed in EXTERNALLY_PRODUCED below
    with the reason it cannot be, so that exemptions are stated rather than
    assumed; a token another language prints whose shape a Rust format string
    fits by coincidence goes in SHAPE_ONLY_FITS, so that the coincidence does
    not read as coverage. The same scan rejects a log line written inline in a
    `wait_for(...)` call, where no constant makes it visible here.
