"""End-to-end acceptance for the egui editor frontend.

PROTECTS: The egui editor: startup, shell patch and reload, dock and viewports, selection and gizmo, inspector and assets, systems and preferences, theme layers, game view, toolbox and grid, recovery and clean exit.
TIER: editor
SETS: editor

Builds against an already-built `pill_editor` binary - verified before use, so
a binary older than the sources it was compiled from is refused rather than
trusted - and starts it on
`scene` - three models and a camera, so the frames are fast and
the heartbeat waits are short - with the scripted input channel
(`PILL_EDITOR_TEST_COMMANDS`), and asserts on its log tokens: startup and the
two scene surfaces (the Scene and Scene 2 viewports), the egui shell module
loading, both tabs reporting rows, a scene click that picks an entity through
the renderer's pick contract, moves the shared selection and publishes the
outline, the inspector reporting the picked entity's detail and one of that
entity's rows edited through the scripted `edit array` (the history step and
the undo that puts the value back), a corner click
that clears both, scripted gizmo drags that translate, rotate and scale the
selected entity (checked through `dump field`), the Assets pipeline (the
listing, a create through its dialog, a rename that the selection follows, a
move, a delete that undoes back, and the write-meta action on a staged
sourced file), the Inspector's asset-settings rows round-tripping through
`edit asset-settings` (a boolean row and an enum row, each applied to the
asset's `.meta` sidecar and undone back to its original value), the Systems
tab's data (a scripted `dump systems`, a recorded system toggle with its
undo, and the pause and step commands reaching the engine), the context
menus (a real right-click opening the viewport's menu, and the menu
actions' command paths: the entity create/delete pair with the delete's
undo, a component detach and attach round-trip, and the gizmo tool, snap
and space switches), the Preferences tab (a seeded preferences file whose
step cap the live reader applies at startup, a scripted row whose save
reaches the file and the reader, the saved snapping step steering a
snapped drag, the history trimming at a tiny cap, and a tool choice
persisting into the project's remembered entry), the editor's theme layers
(a user file named by the `theme` preference, a project file under
`res/editor/` that `editor_settings.yaml` re-points, an out-of-scope path
refused with the rule, a legacy name reported and a broken user file
refused while the other layer applies - each checked through `dump theme`),
the Game tab's viewport
(the primary surface's child window placed at the tab's body while that tab
is the visible one, and hidden with it), the floating toolbox (its rows
switching the tool without picking the scene, and a scripted pointer drag
parking it inside the viewport while it keeps taking input), the infinite
scene grid (on over the scene viewports by default, switched off and on
through the toolbox's grid row while the game viewport never draws it), a dock
rearrangement (an undocked
tab) through the scripted channel, a live patch of the shell that keeps its
frame counter running, a structural edit that reloads the shell and keeps the
rearranged dock, a project reload that keeps the editor UI, the second
viewport's undock with its own scene surface going live at the window's
rectangle, and a clean exit.

Each run keeps its log, sandbox and command file under
`local/editor-validation/egui-<run id>/`. The sandbox belongs to that run: a
fresh run starts from the preferences the suite seeds, and only the in-run
restart reuses the same sandbox, so the dock layout and the clipboard survive
the quit. The only
sources this suite edits are the shell module's, the example project's
(its `scene.rs` and the two `.meta` sidecars whose settings rows the
Inspector step round-trips through the real apply), all restored when the
session closes; everything else it starts is its own process tree.
