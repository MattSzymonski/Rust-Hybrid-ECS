"""
Missing module resource assert suite for Rust-Hybrid-ECS.

PROTECTS: A module's declared asset root stops the host, naming the module and the path, when a required file is gone.
TIER: host

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rust toolchain (cargo)

DESCRIPTION
    A module declares the read-only asset root it ships and the files inside it
    that must be there (`asset_store::declare_module_root`), and
    `asset_store::verify_module_roots` re-checks every root afterwards, outside
    the module-init `catch_unwind`, for a resource that went missing later.

    This suite proves the failing startup end to end, on the one real module
    resource: `pill_master_renderer_data` requires
    `res/defaults/pill.pbr.material`, the PBR chain's default material.

      1. The file is moved aside and the headless dev host is started on
         `examples/project_rs`.
      2. The host must exit non-zero, and its output must carry
         `module 'pill_master_renderer_data' requires its resource
         'defaults/pill.pbr.material', which is missing at` - the module and the
         path, which is what makes the failure diagnosable. The declaration
         asserts inside the module's init, so the loader reports the panic and
         then fails the host; `verify_module_roots` is the same assertion for a
         resource deleted after it was declared, which the engine's unit test
         `a_vanished_resource_fails_the_verification` covers.
      3. It must never reach the project loop: the asset watcher's line, printed
         once the project has loaded, must be absent.
      4. The file is restored byte for byte whatever happens, and the restore is
         verified by reading it back.

    A leftover from an interrupted run (the file still moved aside) is restored
    before anything else happens, so the suite heals its own debris.
