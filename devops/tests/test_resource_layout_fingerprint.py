"""
A resource that declares its layout keeps or rebuilds its value across a reload.

PROTECTS: A declared resource survives an unrelated edit, and is dropped through the retiring image and rebuilt when the file its layout lives in changes.
TIER: host

REQUIREMENTS
  - Python 3.8+
  - Rust toolchain (cargo)

DESCRIPTION
    A resource is not cleared on reload: the value stays and only its function
    table is re-pointed at the new image. That is sound while the two images
    agree on the type's layout, and silently wrong once they do not - the bytes
    keep their size and mean something else. A resource can therefore declare
    the files and crates its layout is made of (`Resource::layout_sources`,
    `Resource::layout_dependencies`), the host fingerprints them into a per-module
    record, and a reload drops the value whose fingerprint changed so the module
    rebuilds it.

    The fixture project carries the witness for exactly this
    (`devops/tests/projects/native/src/layout_witness.rs`): a resource holding a
    heap payload, which prints one line when it is inserted and one when it is
    dropped, and whose declaration names its own file as its only source. The
    suite drives one headless-or-windowed host through three edits:

      1. an edit to a file the witness does not declare (`simulation_time.rs`)
         reloads the project and keeps the live value - no drop line at all;
      2. an edit to the declared file (the witness's build value) prints
         `resource layout changed`, naming the resource and that source, then
         drops the old value (`payload=layout-witness-1`) and inserts the
         rebuilt one (`build_value=2`);
      3. a further edit to an undeclared file keeps the *rebuilt* value, which
         is what proves the record was rewritten after the rebuild: a stale
         record would drop it a second time on every later reload.

    Both edited files are restored byte for byte whatever happens, and the host
    is terminated on every path.
