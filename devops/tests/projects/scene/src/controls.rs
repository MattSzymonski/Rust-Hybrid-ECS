//! Echoes the input a frontend delivers and zooms the camera with the wheel.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Log every key that went down this frame, every mouse button that did, and
//!   the camera distance after a scroll.
//! - Move the camera along its viewing axis when the wheel turns, clamped to a
//!   range the scene still fits in.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The lines are the observation point the web suite matches on: an input that
//! never reached the game leaves one of them absent, and no frame-based check
//! can tell "the frontend forwards input" from "the scene is static". They are
//! written here, in the project, because that is what proves the event reached
//! the world rather than the frontend's own log.
