//! Creates the camera and the three rotating models.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Add the camera when the world has none.
//! - Spawn one model per showcase slot, each rotating around its own axis and
//!   tagged so a reload re-runs the system without stacking duplicates.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Every model draws the same mesh at the same scale. The bundled model is
//! authored roughly six world units across and standing on `y = 0`, so each
//! instance is scaled down and lowered by half its drawn height: the models
//! straddle the axis the camera looks down, which is what a click at the middle
//! of the viewport lands on. The middle model sits on that axis, so a pick at
//! the window's centre answers with it on every run.
