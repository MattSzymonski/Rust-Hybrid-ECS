//! A manager whose tuning comes from a settings asset of its own type.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declares a standalone settings asset (`.fixture_settings`) whose document
//!   is the three knobs the manager reads, so the host has a real asset to
//!   create from the defaults and re-apply on an edit.
//! - Declares the manager that applies that document.
//! - Prints the values it is asked to apply, and why it refused a document, so
//!   the manager-settings suite can see the live state through the host log.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The fixture's whole job is to be observable. Its applier keeps what it reads,
//! logs one line per apply, and refuses a value it cannot use - a negative gain
//! must be a refusal, not a silent no-op, which is the failure a person cannot
//! see.
//!
//! It is a shared resource, so the value survives a reload: the host then
//! re-applies the settings asset to the regenerated manager, which is what the
//! suite checks after an unrelated source edit.
