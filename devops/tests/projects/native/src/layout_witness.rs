//! A resource whose declared layout proves the keep-or-rebuild decision.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Holds heap state, so a value that was dropped and one that was leaked can
//!   be told apart, and prints one line when it is dropped.
//! - Declares the file that defines its layout, and nothing else, so the
//!   keep-or-rebuild suites can edit exactly one source and know what the host
//!   should decide.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The suites need three observable outcomes for one resource across a reload:
//! kept, dropped through the retiring image, and rebuilt. The declaration is
//! what makes the first and the second different, and the drop line is what
//! proves the value was dropped by the image that owned its drop function
//! rather than leaked.
//!
//! [`WITNESS_BUILD_VALUE`] is part of the declared file, so an edit to it is an
//! edit to the layout. The value inserted at build time is printed both when it
//! is created and when it is dropped, which is how a suite proves that the
//! rebuild produced the new value rather than restoring the old one.
