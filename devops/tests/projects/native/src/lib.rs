//! Hot-reloadable bouncing-ball project implemented with ECS systems.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Runs the ball physics: [`BALL_COUNT`] balls bouncing inside a fixed box,
//!   stepped by the frame delta the host clock reports.
//! - Drives the project's single [`Spline`]: its control points are the ball
//!   centres, and one [`SplineSample`] dot sits on the curve every
//!   [`SPLINE_SAMPLE_STEP`] of `t`.
//! - Carries the migration witnesses (`migration`): four persistable
//!   components whose values print once per generation, so a schema change can
//!   be proven to preserve them.
//! - Carries the layout witness (`layout_witness`): one resource that declares
//!   the file its layout is made of, and prints when it is inserted and dropped,
//!   so the keep-or-rebuild decision across a reload is observable.
//! - Carries the settings manager (`settings_probe`): a manager resource with a
//!   settings surface, so the host's per-manager settings pipeline has a subject
//!   whose applied values are visible in the log.
//! - Exposes the two entry points the host resolves in this artifact through
//!   the project-module ABI: `pill_module_register`, which re-registers the
//!   systems and resources on every generation, and `pill_module_init`, the
//!   one-time seeding of the scene.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The project is a plain `cdylib` that registers ECS components, resources,
//! and systems during `pill_module_register`, against the engine the host hands
//! it through [`EngineApi`]. The scene itself is seeded by `pill_module_init`,
//! which the host calls once, on the first load. A hot reload repeats the
//! registration and never the seeding, so the entities the first generation
//! created are the ones every later generation steps.
//!
//! Balls and spline are tied together by data rather than by an entity
//! relationship: `spline_path_system` copies the ball centres into the control
//! point array on every frame, which keeps every component in the scene plain,
//! serializable data. xx
