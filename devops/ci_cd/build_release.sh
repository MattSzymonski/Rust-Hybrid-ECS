#!/usr/bin/env bash

# REQUIREMENTS: bash 4+, Rust toolchain (cargo) on PATH. Run from anywhere; the
#               script locates the repository root itself.

# DESCRIPTION: Builds the workspace's release profile, which a plain
#   `cargo build --release` cannot do.
#
#   The obstacle is `-C prefer-dynamic` in `modules/.cargo/config.toml`. It is
#   there so the host executable and every optional module share one copy of
#   `pill_engine`, which is what keeps its statics, thread-locals and tracing
#   dispatcher single-instance across the DLL boundary. A release binary links
#   everything into one image and needs none of that - and rustc refuses
#   `-C prefer-dynamic` together with the release profile's `lto = "fat"` when
#   targeting Windows, so the flag has to go for a release build to happen at
#   all.
#
#   Cargo offers no way to make `build.rustflags` conditional on the profile.
#   `--config build.rustflags=[]` does not work either: cargo MERGES config
#   arrays under the same key, so an empty list joins with the existing one and
#   changes nothing. Clearing `RUSTFLAGS` in the environment is the only
#   mechanism that does, which is why this is a script rather than a cargo
#   alias - an alias cannot set environment variables.
#
#   Everything else about the build is ordinary cargo. Extra arguments are
#   forwarded, so this is a drop-in replacement for `cargo build --release`.

# USAGE: devops/ci_cd/build_release.sh [cargo arguments...]
#          (no arguments)      Build the shipping host release (project from
#                              PROJECT_PATH, bundle regenerated; static_project
#                              for a native project, static_csharp for a
#                              managed C# project)
#          --profile <name>   Build a different release profile
#                             (release-fast, release-with-debug)
#          --project <path>   Project directory (workspace-relative) whose
#                             project_settings.yaml drives the shipping bundle
#                             (defaults to PROJECT_PATH)
#          Any other argument is passed straight to cargo.
#
#   A release build of the host is always the shipping posture: release
#   building `pill_standalone` requires `--no-default-features --features
#   static_project` (or `static_csharp`), and the script refuses any other
#   way - as does `pill_standalone`'s build script, for direct cargo builds.
#   A managed (C#) project is additionally built with `dotnet build -c
#   Release` before the host, and its assemblies are copied alongside the
#   shipping binary.

# EXAMPLE USAGE:
#   set PROJECT_PATH=examples/project_rs
#   devops/ci_cd/build_release.sh                            # native shipping host release
#   set PROJECT_PATH=examples/project_cs
#   devops/ci_cd/build_release.sh                            # managed (C#) shipping host release
#   devops/ci_cd/build_release.sh -p pill_engine             # release-build any package
