//! The native editor's errors.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declares [`EditorError`], what an editor run can end with: event-loop
//!   and window creation, the editor's own GPU device, or a fatal frame.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The error lives in the crate that owns the event loop, like
//! `pill_standalone`'s. Every leaf carries its `wgpu` or `winit` source
//! unchanged, so the styled report at the reporting boundary shows the
//! driver's own message.
