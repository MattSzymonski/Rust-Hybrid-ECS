//! The game UI: an egui context a project draws through, painted by the
//! renderer.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`GameUi`]: the egui context, the published pointer and keyboard claims,
//!   and the texture mirror.
//! - [`GameUi::run`]: one pass that takes the engine's input, builds the
//!   frame's draw list and textures, and publishes them into the world's
//!   [`UiFrameSlot`].
//! - [`install`] and [`install_with_theme`]: put the resource into a project's
//!   world with its theme, plus the system that re-applies the theme when the
//!   override file is reimported.
//! - [`mod@convert`], [`input`], [`textures`]: the three pieces it composes.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! This crate is a shared `dylib`, so the egui context and what it holds -
//! fonts, widget state, textures - outlive a project reload. [`GameUi`] lives
//! here too, so every reload sees the same type. The rule that
//! `pill_editor_core` states applies here as well: nothing a module defines
//! may be stored in the context.
//!
//! This pass is the only producer for the world's [`UiFrameSlot`], and it
//! publishes a frame built from `pill_ui_frame` types. The renderer therefore
//! never sees egui, and no renderer links this crate. A game gates its own
//! input on [`GameUi::wants_pointer`] / [`GameUi::wants_keyboard`].
