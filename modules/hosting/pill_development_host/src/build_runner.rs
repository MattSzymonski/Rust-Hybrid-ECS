//! Build execution, artifact staging and output-path resolution.
//!
//! Build output reaches the host's standard streams, so compiler progress and
//! diagnostics stay visible in the terminal that launched the host.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Run each backend's build command from the workspace root.
//! - Find the artifact each backend is expected to produce.
//! - Copy built artifacts into a private hot-load directory and stamp them, so
//!   a later process can tell them from the output of another build.
//! - Check that an artifact exists before the host tries to load it.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`run_build_command`] treats a build as an opaque process: it does not read
//! the compiler's output and decides success from the child's exit status
//! alone. Cancellation works by agreement: a newer source save increases a
//! generation counter, and the watchdog loop stops the child - and the
//! [`BuildProcessTree`] it started - when it sees the counter change. The
//! startup batch ([`build_extension_batch`]) builds every module with one cargo
//! command, and each module then takes its share through
//! [`take_batch_validation`].
