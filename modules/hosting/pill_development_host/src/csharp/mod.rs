//! C# development tooling over the `pill_csharp_bridge` backend.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Generates the C# mirrors for the components, value types, object
//!   classes, enums, resource markers and free functions an extension exposes
//!   to managed code.
//! - Recompiles the project in-process with Roslyn on a hot reload.
//! - Pairs the bridge's [`CSharpRuntime`] with that compiler as the host's
//!   managed project, [`CSharpProject`].
//! - Re-exports the bridge items the rest of the host names, under one path.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The bridge owns everything needed to run C#: hosting .NET, the ABI,
//! components, systems and the reload poll. A C# shipping bundle links the
//! bridge without this crate. This module holds only what exists while
//! developing: the generated mirrors and the compiler. The whole module is
//! `hot_reload` only.
