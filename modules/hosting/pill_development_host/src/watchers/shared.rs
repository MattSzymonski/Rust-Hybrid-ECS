//! Watch the configured source tree for file changes and tell the main
//! thread to reload.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Spawn a worker thread that watches the source tree for changes.
//! - Decide which file events and paths count as a source edit, so only a
//!   real edit starts a reload.
//! - Bump a reload generation counter when a relevant event arrives;
//!   the main thread reloads when it sees a generation it has not handled.
//! - Record when each signal fired, so the frame loop can time a reload from
//!   the save that caused it.
//! - Report which files changed, so a reload can be traced back to a save.
//! - Let `notify` handle the differences between the platforms' file
//!   notifications.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The watcher runs on its own thread, so watching never blocks the main
//! loop. Several notifications for one save are joined into one signal: the
//! worker waits out the debounce window, collects the paths it saw and
//! reports them. The main thread compares the generation counter against the
//! last value it handled on every loop, so a save that arrives during a
//! reload is never lost.
