//! Host activity notes for an attached editor frontend.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Define [`HostNotice`]: what happened, in editor-agnostic terms.
//! - Queue notices from anywhere in `pill_development_host`, dropping the
//!   oldest once the queue is full.
//! - Hand the queue to the frontend's per-frame drain ([`take`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The host already reports reloads, patches, failures and rollbacks as log
//! lines, but a log line is only text. An editor frontend needs the values
//! behind it - which module, how long the build took, which generation now
//! runs - to raise its own notices and fill its problems list, so the same
//! events are queued here as plain data as well.
//!
//! The queue is process-global, like the analytics collector: the events are
//! raised from `&mut DevHost` paths, from reload reports and from places that
//! hold no host reference, and the editor wants them all in one list. A host
//! with no editor attached never drains the queue, so [`NOTICE_CAPACITY`]
//! keeps it bounded.
//!
//! A notice carries owned strings only. Queues and drains run on the host's
//! main thread - the startup loads queue before the first frame - and the
//! build runner's reader thread never writes here, so the mutex alone is
//! enough.
