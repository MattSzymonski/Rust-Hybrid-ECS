//! Lifecycle management for the active native or managed project module.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Builds and loads the selected backend during startup.
//! - Reloads a native generation through a graveyard (the retired library
//!   images the host keeps mapped), so pointers into an earlier image stay
//!   valid.
//! - Leaves managed reload polling to the C# bridge's runtime, through
//!   `crate::csharp`.
//! - Keeps a record of each generation's registrations - persistable type
//!   names, schema hashes, resource ids and every component name - so the next
//!   reload can tell what changed and what another module still declares.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The host keeps exactly one [`LoadedProject`] alive at a time. A native
//! reload runs through [`reload_native`], which hands the build, the private
//! copy and the swap to `crate::reload`. The replaced DLL moves into a bounded
//! graveyard and stays mapped until no column needs its tables, so
//! engine-owned pointers into the old image stay valid while changed persist
//! schemas are migrated. A managed backend leaves assembly discovery and
//! validation to the C# bridge's runtime, which reports success or rejection
//! through `poll_reload`.

// This module covers the whole loaded-project lifecycle: build, load,
// initialize, reload and retire.
