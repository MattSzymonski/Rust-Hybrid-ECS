//! Unit tests for the hot-patch subsystem.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Checks which edits classification accepts as body-only, and why it
//!   refuses the rest.
//! - Checks patch naming, the staged rlib refresh and the rollback
//!   refusals.
//! - Checks what a reload does to the baseline snapshot and to the patch
//!   history.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The tests live beside the code they exercise, so the implementation half
//! of the module stays free of test scaffolding. They reach the module's
//! private items through `use super::*`.
