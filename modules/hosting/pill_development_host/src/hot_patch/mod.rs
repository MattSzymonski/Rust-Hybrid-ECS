//! Per-function hot patching: the fast path beside the whole-module reload.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Decide whether a source change is a body-only edit of a function the host
//!   can address, and refuse loudly when it is anything else.
//! - Generate, compile and load a small patch library for that one function.
//! - Install the replacement at a frame boundary: the engine's registry, an
//!   artifact's dispatch slot, or the function's prologue.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! This never replaces the whole-module reload. It tries first, and every
//! change it refuses goes to [`LoadedProject::reload`](crate::project_module).
//!
//! The check is deliberately careful. It removes the bodies of the functions
//! the host can reach from both the old and the new source, then compares the
//! rest. A body-only edit of those functions leaves the two versions equal; a
//! changed signature, type, constant, import or other function keeps them
//! different. Refusing a patch only costs one reload. Accepting one by mistake
//! would install code built for a memory layout the running world no longer
//! has, so the check prefers to refuse.
//!
//! Patch libraries are never unloaded: a dispatch slot may point into one for
//! the rest of the process.

// A development-only facility, refused at compile time in an optimized build.
//
// Hot patching runs `rustc`, writes DLLs into the temp directory and loads
// them into the running process, and every annotated function pays an
// indirection. None of that belongs in a shipped binary, and shipping it by
// accident would fail quietly instead of loudly - so the build stops here.
// Enable it only in a debug profile.
