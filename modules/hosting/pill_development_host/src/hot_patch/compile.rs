//! Capturing and replaying the exact `rustc` invocation cargo uses.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Ask cargo once, in verbose mode, for the command it builds a crate with.
//! - Replay that command with a different input file and output path.
//! - Cache the result, invalidated by the build command and the inputs'

//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Working out `--extern` and `-L native` by hand is the most fragile part of
//! a patch pipeline. It means naming one rlib metadata hash and every registry
//! path, so it breaks whenever a dependency changes and cannot run on another
//! machine. Cargo already knows the right answer, so this asks it instead of
