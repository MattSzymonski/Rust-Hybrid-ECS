//! A patched function's history, and the routes back through it.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Record every generation of every function this session replaced.
//! - Expose that history as a list the host can print and tooling can read.
//! - Reinstall an earlier generation, or the artifact's own original code.
//! - Forget prologue records a reload has invalidated.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Undoing a patch is not one operation; how a generation was delivered decides
//! how it is undone. A generation installed into a slot is undone by writing one
//! pointer. A generation applied by overwriting the function's first bytes is
//! undone by writing those bytes back. The case is recorded with the generation
//! rather than read from the function's kind, because an annotated and an
//! un-annotated plain function share one kind and are undone in different ways.
//!
//! A reload makes every recorded prologue address invalid at once, in every
//! session. Each address points into an image the graveyard (where the reload
//! keeps retired images until it releases them) will unmap, and one module's
//! records include addresses inside the project image, so the records cannot be
//! cleared selectively. Dropping the whole set is what stops a rollback from
//! writing into a retired image.
