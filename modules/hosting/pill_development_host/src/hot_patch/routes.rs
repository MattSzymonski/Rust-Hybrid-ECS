//! How a compiled replacement reaches every running copy of a function.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Find a function's address and signature inside a loaded patch image.
//! - Visit every image that may hold a copy: the loaded artifacts first, then
//!   the patches already in the process.
//! - Install, reset or prologue-patch that function in each of them.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A crate linked into several artifacts is compiled into each of them, and a
//! generated patch links its own copy of everything its body calls. A
//! replacement that reached only the crate's own DLL would leave every other
//! copy running the old code. That is why all three routes send the change to
//! both kinds of image, through one shared traversal ([`every_loaded_copy`])
//! instead of each one visiting the images itself.
//!
//! If that traversal skipped the patches, a chain of hot functions would stop
//! updating: a patched caller would keep calling the callee as it was when the
//! caller was compiled.
