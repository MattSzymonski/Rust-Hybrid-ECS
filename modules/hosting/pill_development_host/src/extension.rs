//! Loading and reloading of extension modules.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Builds, checks and loads one extension when the host starts.
//! - Reloads one module on its own: after a source edit, after a runtime crate
//!   in its folder reloads, or when a retry is requested.
//! - Clears only that module's systems when it is replaced.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Each loaded module has one [`ExtensionSlot`]. The slot holds the module's
//! configuration, its [`SystemOwner`], the library that is loaded now and the
//! retired libraries that are still mapped. It keeps a limited number of
//! retired libraries unless the module asks to keep every generation. A reload
//! works like the project reload: the replacement is compiled and loaded
//! before any engine state is touched, and a failure at any step leaves the
//! previous generation running.
//!
//! The module reloads on its own. Its own watcher adds to a counter that only
//! this module reads, and its systems are removed through
//! [`Engine::clear_systems_owned_by`] instead of the global clear. Reloading
//! one module therefore never disturbs the project or another module.
