//! The sequence every reload runs after its replacement image has loaded.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Save the retiring generation's persistable metadata, then run the new
//!   generation's init. If init fails, put the old generation back.
//! - Drop what the new generation no longer registers, and point every
//!   surviving storage table at code that is still loaded.
//! - Migrate persistable data whose layout changed in the swap.
//! - Move the previous image into the graveyard.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The project and every extension run the same sequence. They differ in three
//! ways. An extension tags its registrations with its [`SystemOwner`], while
//! the project owns the scheduler and tags nothing. Their log text differs
//! because the suites in `devops/tests` wait for those exact lines, so the two
//! wordings must stay tellable apart. Both keep the component names their
//! generation registered, but only a module's names go on to the C# mirror.
//!
//! **The step order is load-bearing and must not be changed.**
//! `drop_forgotten_components` calls drop functions that live in the retiring
//! image, so it has to run while that image is still loaded.
//! `rehome_native_columns` then gives every native column (the table of
//! function pointers that operates on one component's stored rows) a table from
//! a generation that is still loaded. Both must finish before the graveyard
//! releases any image; that order is what makes a bound of two generations
//! safe. Swapping them causes a call into unloaded memory, and the crash shows
//! up two reloads later, not at once.
