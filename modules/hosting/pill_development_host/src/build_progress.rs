//! The startup build plan: which modules a start builds, announced up front
//! and counted as each build starts.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Log that hot reloading of a project is starting, with the numbered list
//!   of modules the host is about to build, as one multi-line entry
//!   ([`announce_plan`]).
//! - Log `[n/m] ------------- Building of <module> started` when one of those
//!   builds begins ([`announce_build`]), once per module.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The plan lives in one global because the start records it in `setup` and
//! the builds that report against it run elsewhere: the extensions and the
//! project build during `setup`, while the renderer's GPU module builds only
//! once a window opens. A build of a module that is not in the plan, or no
//! longer in it (any reload), is not announced here; its caller logs it.
