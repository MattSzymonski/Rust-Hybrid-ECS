//! Project-module configuration shared by every host frontend.

//! - Describes how a project module is built, watched, and loaded.
//! - Infers the complete configuration from a single project directory.
//! - Validates the assembled configuration before any build work starts.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`ProjectModuleConfig`] owns every configured value and is built by
//! [`ProjectModuleConfig::from_environment`] from one variable, `PROJECT_PATH`,
//! which names the project directory relative to the workspace root. The
//! backend (native Rust or managed C#) is detected from the manifest files in
//! that directory (`Cargo.toml` or `*.csproj`), and every path, command, and
//! assembly name is derived from the manifest, so no project identity is
//! compiled into the host binary. A missing or unreadable project fails fast
//! with a [`ConfigError`] naming the offending path, and
//! [`ProjectModuleConfig::validate`] reports the first invalid field so
//! callers can correct it directly.
