//! Development shader reload, host half: watch a shader source tree, re-cook
//! edits, and queue the results.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Watch one tree for HLSL edits, wait for a burst of events to stop
//!   (debounce), and then cook the whole tree with
//!   [`pill_assets::cook_shader_tree`]. That is the same routine the data
//!   crate's build script runs, so both produce the same outputs.
//! - Queue every output whose text changed as a [`CookedShader`] for the main
//!   thread, with both the output's and its source's path.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Two trees are watched with this worker: the renderer data crate's
//! `shader_sources/`, whose outputs the data crate's own export applies to the
//! shaders built from that tree, and the project's `res`, whose outputs are
//! read by the shader asset's import and therefore only need the asset to be
//! reimported.
//!
//! The worker thread runs only host code and `slangc`, never inside a module
//! image, so a data crate reload can swap the image at any time. The main
//! thread hands the queue over at the frame boundary, after the reloads, using
//! the export of the data generation that is current at that moment.
//!
//! Cooking writes only stale outputs, so editing a header makes every source
//! stale again. A cook that fails is logged and queues nothing, so the shaders
//! already loaded keep drawing. What gets queued is every output whose text
//! differs from the last text the worker saw for it, not only the outputs this
//! cook rebuilt. The data crate's build script runs the same cook, so it can
//! reach an edited source first; the worker then finds nothing stale, yet the
//! edit still has to reach the running world. Only `.hlsl` events count. The
//! cooked `.wgsl` files sit beside the sources and would otherwise feed back
//! in as edits.
