//! The development host: it runs a project and its extensions as DLLs, and
//! reloads them while the game keeps running.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Build and load the extensions and the project, and watch their sources.
//! - Reload, patch and roll back at each frame boundary, just before the
//!   wrapped [`pill_player::Runtime`] runs its frame ([`run_frame`]).
//! - With `rendering`: load the renderer as a reloadable module, rebuild it
//!   when its data crate reloads, stop it while it would read a component
//!   layout it was not built against, and pass on every shader the watcher
//!   re-cooks ([`RenderingHost`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Compiled only with `hot_reload`. The engine, its frame and the renderer's
//! window live in `pill_player`, which a shipping build runs directly. This
//! module adds what developing needs around them: [`DevHost`] wraps the
//! runtime for the headless path, and [`RenderingHost`] adds the renderer
//! module and the surfaces it draws on. Loading that differs per backend
//! stays behind [`LoadedProject`].
