//! The development host: it builds a project and its extensions as loadable
//! modules and reloads them while the project runs.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Builds and loads native or C# project modules and the extensions.
//! - Watches project sources and runs hot reloads at frame boundaries, just
//!   before the wrapped [`pill_player::Runtime`] runs its frame.
//! - Exposes [`setup`], [`run_frame`] and, when the host draws into a window,
//!   [`setup_rendering`] and [`attach_renderer`]. A frontend owns its event
//!   loop and drives the host through [`FrameDriver`].
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The configuration types ([`ProjectModuleConfig`], [`HostConfig`]) keep
//! backend selection out of executable crates. Running the game is
//! `pill_player`'s job: the engine, the frame, the statically linked project
//! and the renderer's window. A shipping build links that crate without this
//! one. Everything this crate does is development work, so nothing here is
//! behind a feature: what a run watches is decided at startup by the switches
//! in [`switches`].
