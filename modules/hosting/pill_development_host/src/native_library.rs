//! Loading native project and extension libraries, resolving their exports
//! and keeping the temporary copies that outlive a reload.
//!
//! Each module gets a file at a path of its own before it is opened: a hard
//! link to the build output when the filesystem allows one, a copy otherwise.
//! A rebuilt DLL can then replace the build output while an older generation
//! stays mapped, because the raw pointers and vtables the engine holds still
//! point into it.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Load native libraries from unique temporary paths.
//! - Check the required exports, read the ABI revision and call the
//!   registration entry point.
//! - Explain a failed load from the artifact's own import tables.
//! - Remove temporary copies left behind by earlier host processes.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The native ABI is one fixed export contract. A project and an extension are
//! the same kind of loadable artifact: same exports, same loader, same reload
//! transaction, same way of being retired. The loader therefore has nothing to
//! parameterise.
//!
//! - `pill_module_init(*const EngineApi) -> u32` - required: registers
//!   components and systems before the first frame and returns zero on
//!   success. Any other status fails the load transaction, and the previous
//!   generation is initialized again.
//! - `pill_module_abi_version() -> u32` - optional: read before any other
//!   function is called, so an incompatible artifact is rejected instead of
//!   invoked.
//!
//! Exports are cached at load time as raw function pointers, which stay valid
//! while the library handle keeps the image mapped. `pill_module_init` must be
//! safe to call more than once.
