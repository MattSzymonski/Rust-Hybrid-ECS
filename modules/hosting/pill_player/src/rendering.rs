//! A renderer attached to a window, and the runtime that draws a statically
//! linked project there.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Keep a renderer backend and the window it draws on together, and drop the
//!   backend first ([`AttachedRenderer`]). Resize a surface, set its
//!   viewport, move rendering to another window, and draw the frame the
//!   `rendering` system filled in.
//! - Run a statically linked project in a window ([`RenderingRuntime`]):
//!   register the linked renderer, attach it, and draw every frame.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The development host has its own windowed host because its renderer is a
//! reloadable module, but it keeps the same [`AttachedRenderer`]. The two
//! differ only in where a backend comes from, never in how it is kept or
//! drawn with.
