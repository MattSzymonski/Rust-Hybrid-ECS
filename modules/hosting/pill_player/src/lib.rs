//! Runs a game: the engine, its frames, and the statically linked project.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Owns the [`pill_engine::Engine`] and runs frames ([`Runtime`]).
//! - Defines the static-link contract ([`StaticProject`], [`StaticModule`],
//!   [`StaticRenderer`], [`StaticProjectBackend`], [`ProjectBackend`]) and
//!   registers a linked project in the same order, and under the same owners,
//!   as the hot-reloading host.
//! - Gives every registering part (a module, the renderer or the project) the
//!   owner its ECS systems are recorded under, and runs an entry point with
//!   that owner in effect ([`registration`]). The development host uses the
//!   same owners.
//! - With `rendering`: attaches a renderer to a window passed as raw handles
//!   ([`RendererWindow`], [`attach_renderer`]) and draws frames
//!   ([`AttachedRenderer`], [`RenderingRuntime`]).
//! - Installs the telemetry stack ([`init_telemetry`]) and defines
//!   [`FrameDriver`], the trait a frontend's loop drives.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Linked into every executable: the development host
//! (`pill_development_host`) builds on it, and a shipping build and a web
//! build use it without the host. It therefore holds only what a shipped game
//! needs: no DLL loading, file watching, build tools, .NET hosting, winit or
//! YAML. A C# project reaches it as an external [`ProjectBackend`] that
//! `pill_csharp_bridge` implements.
