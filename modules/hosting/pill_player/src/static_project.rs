//! Statically linked project and module registration, for shipping builds.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Describes a project and its extensions as ordinary Rust functions that
//!   are compiled into the binary, rather than as DLLs found at run time.
//! - Initializes them in the same order, and under the same owners, that the
//!   hot-reloading host uses.
//! - Defines [`ProjectBackend`], the extension point through which a project
//!   that is not Rust (a C# assembly, through `pill_csharp_bridge`) starts.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The dependency direction forces this shape. This crate cannot name the
//! project crate, or every game would need its own player, so the crate that
//! links both - the generated shipping bundle - passes the functions in. That
//! also makes the set of linked modules visible at the call site. A shipping
//! build wants exactly that: the bundle generator reads
//! `project_settings.yaml` while the binary is built, and the released binary
//! holds what the generator baked in instead of reading a settings file.
//!
//! For the same reason this crate names no C# type: a managed project arrives
//! as a [`StaticProjectBackend::External`] backend the bridge implements, so a
//! build that runs no C# links none of it.
//!
//! A linked entry point runs the same transaction as the macro-generated
//! `pill_module_init` wrapper. `register_all_components` drains this artifact's
//! `inventory` registry into the world first; skipping it fails as "my
//! components do not exist" rather than as a link error. The wrapper also
//! catches panics. Here there is no C ABI to unwind across, so a panic stays an
//! ordinary Rust panic instead of becoming a status that hides the backtrace.
