//! Engine ownership and the frame every build runs.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Own the [`Engine`] at a stable address, and whatever must outlive it.
//! - Start a statically linked project ([`setup`]).
//! - Mount a project's asset pack and index it ([`mount_asset_pack`]).
//! - Run one frame: systems, deferred commands, failure reporting, frame
//!   statistics ([`Runtime::run_frame_from`]).
//! - Define [`FrameDriver`], the interface a frontend's loop drives.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The development host wraps a [`Runtime`] and does its reload work around
//! the frame; a shipping build runs one itself, or the runtime wrapped by the
//! renderer when it draws. Both reach the same frame code, so a shipped game
//! runs its systems the same way the game did while it was developed.
