// Managed-side driver for the host's parallel dispatch slot.
//
// Responsibilities:
// - Run one parallel call's work items across the host's shared Rayon pool
//   through EngineApi.ParallelFor, joining before returning.
// - Catch each work item's exception on its worker and rethrow the first one
//   on the calling thread.
//
// Design:
// - The per-call state is the GCHandle target: callbacks receive its address
//   back as an opaque pointer, so two systems dispatching concurrently never
//   share state and nothing static outlives a call.
// - Nothing in a work item may touch engine APIs: workers carry no managed
//   invocation scope, and every engine entry point refuses them on its own.
//   The calling thread is checked for a scope before dispatching.
