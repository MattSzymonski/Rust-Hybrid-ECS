// Managed parallel row execution: segments, slicing and dispatch.
//
// Responsibilities:
// - Snapshot a query's resolved chunks into ParallelSegment views worker
//   threads can read and write without touching the engine.
// - Split each chunk's rows into work items and run them through the host's
//   shared pool (Engine.ParallelFor), or inline when there is one item.
// - Refuse entry without a managed invocation scope, and refuse nested
//   passes, before any row is touched.
//
// Design:
// - Resolution stays on the frame thread: the enumerator walks chunks with
//   the same MoveToNextChunk the sequential path uses, validates scope tokens
//   once per chunk, then hands out raw pointers.
// - Workers run generated slice bodies over ParallelSegment helpers - pointer
//   arithmetic and tick writes only. An engine call from a worker is refused
//   by the thread-local scope check every engine entry point already performs.
// - Managed queries have chunk-level matching only, so segments need no row
//   masks. If per-row filters are ever added, segments must carry them.
// - Failure policy: a throwing row ends its own work item there; the other
//   work items still run (the join completes), and the first exception is
//   rethrown on the calling thread after the join - the same shape as the
//   engine's native parallel systems.
// - The default slice guidance mirrors the engine's (4096 rows, minimum 256)
//   so managed and native parallelism split work similarly.
