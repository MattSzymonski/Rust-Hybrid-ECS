//! Starts a hosted .NET runtime for a C# project, finds the systems it
//! declares, and registers them with the engine's scheduler.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Start .NET (CoreCLR through hostfxr, or a NativeAOT library) and resolve
//!   every managed export the host calls.
//! - Register the component manifest the managed side reports, then run its
//!   startup methods so a failure leaves no half-built world.
//! - Reflect each system's accesses and register the system under that exact
//!   read/write list.
//! - Poll the managed loader after a rebuild, decide whether the arriving
//!   component manifest can be applied, and re-register the project's systems
//!   when their signatures changed.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Every unmanaged export is resolved once at startup into a plain function
//! pointer held by the [`CSharpRuntime`] host. A registered system never calls
//! the runtime directly: each registration captures the resolved pointers, its
//! reflected access list and a shared [`BindingStore`] handle. [`CSharpRuntime`]
//! owns the runtime and the API table those pointers come from, so keeping the
//! host alive keeps every registered system valid.
//!
//! A reload is a handshake with the managed loader. The loader holds the new
//! assembly back until the host has applied its component manifest, and only
//! then swaps it in. [`ManagedSystemSnapshot`] records what the active assembly
//! declared, so a reload can tell a changed system body (nothing to
//! re-register) from a changed signature (rebuild the project's systems).
