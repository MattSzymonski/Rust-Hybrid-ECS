//! The apply pipeline that every managed manifest kind runs through.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Decide what each arriving declaration means for the live binding table:
//!   nothing changed, a new entry, a rename through an alias, or a reshape.
//! - Apply the entries in manifest order, recording what would undo each
//!   applied entry so a later refusal can unwind them.
//! - Retire the entries the manifest stopped naming, after everything else.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Every manifest kind needs the same stages in the same order. What one kind
//! contributes arrives as a [`ManifestSubject`]: a plain struct of function
//! pointers, in the same style as the `ColumnOps` and `StorageFactory` tables
//! that carry per-kind behaviour elsewhere in the engine. Everything else
//! lives here, once.
//!
//! - **Aliases are resolved before vanished entries are collected**, so when
//!   an alias reaches a predecessor that is still live, that predecessor counts
//!   as renamed instead of as gone.
//! - **Every entry is resolved before any of them is applied**, so the refusals
//!   that the manifest's own validation cannot find leave the world and the
//!   table as they were.
//! - **Retirement runs last**, because it drops bytes and cannot be undone.
//!
//! ## What rollback can and cannot promise
//!
//! The table is all-or-nothing: the pipeline works on a copy, and the caller
//! publishes whatever comes back. A component's reshape comes with an undo that
//! moves the rows back. A resource's reshape cannot do that, because reversing
//! it would have to invent the bytes it dropped. That reshape therefore stays
//! applied with its new binding: the table has to keep describing the layout
//! the engine holds, because the resource view callback checks the live byte
//! length against it.
