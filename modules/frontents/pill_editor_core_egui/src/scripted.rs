//! The scripted test channel's grammar: one typed parse of the lines the
//! suites append to the command file.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Parse one scripted line into a [`ScriptedCommand`] ([`ScriptedCommand::parse`]),
//!   or explain why it cannot run.
//! - Keep the grammar - the verbs, their arguments and their value forms -
//!   in one file instead of a runner, so it can be listed and table-tested
//!   without launching an editor.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The vocabulary is the suites' API: `test_editor_egui.py` writes these
//! lines, so a verb name or an argument order cannot change without the suite
//! noticing. The desktop editor and the browser editor both parse with this
//! module and dispatch the commands their posture can run, so the two
//! vocabularies cannot drift; a verb a posture cannot run is refused through
//! the same `[editor] scripted command rejected` line the Python side raises
//! on.
//!
//! The module is UI-free and window-free (it only names the model types),
//! which is what lets the browser build link it.
//!
//! Arguments are whitespace-separated words, except where the trailing value
//! is free text: `edit set`, `edit array`, `edit asset-settings`,
//! `edit preference`, `dialog set name`, `browser`, `select asset` and the
//! asset-edit paths take the rest of the line, so a value keeps its spaces.
//! One pair of surrounding double quotes is removed and `\"` / `\\` are
//! resolved, so a value that needs its own leading or trailing space can be
//! quoted (`edit set 3v0 ShowcaseComponent note "  padded  "`).
//!
//! `key <chord>` injects a keyboard chord (`ctrl+z`, `shift+delete`, `w`):
//! the names are the modifier words `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `super` joined to
//! the key with `+`, and the key is a letter, a digit, `f1`..`f24` or one of
//! the named editing keys listed by [`key_code_name`].
