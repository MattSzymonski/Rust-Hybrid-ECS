//! The egui shell's long-lived session state.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Own [`EguiShellState`], the shell's one world resource: the reload handle,
//!   the pass scratch, the measurements and the two requests the shell and the
//!   executable exchange.
//! - Own the per-tab and chrome state those groups are made of: the menu bar's
//!   geometry ([`MenubarSession`]), the Inspector's rows and geometry
//!   ([`InspectorSession`]), the toolbox ([`ToolboxSession`]), the command
//!   palette ([`PaletteState`]), the toasts ([`ToastSession`]), the windows
//!   modules open ([`PanelWindowSession`]) and the asset previews
//!   ([`PreviewStates`]).
//! - Own the measurements the Statistics tab and the log read
//!   ([`StatisticsSession`], [`PanelBudget`]) and the two log-once caches
//!   ([`LoggedRects`], [`LoggedTexts`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`EguiShellState`]'s fields fall into four groups, and a new field belongs
//! to the group whose owner and boundary it shares:
//!
//! - **the reload handle** - `context`, `dock`, `mark`, `popout_contexts`,
//!   `applied_theme_generation`, `panels_remapped`: what a shell generation
//!   must find exactly where the previous one left it. The executable never
//!   writes these.
//! - **pass scratch** - the dialog, the preferences draft, the toolbox, the
//!   browser, the Inspector, the menu bar, the toasts, the palette, the panel
//!   windows and the previews: the shell owns them, and they survive a reload
//!   only so a redraw continues where it was.
//! - **measurements** - `frame_index`, `stats`, `panel_budget`: the shell
//!   writes them around each pass; the Statistics tab and the log read them.
//! - **requests** - `requests` (a pass's asks for the executable, drained onto
//!   the frame) and `pending_panel_window` (the scripted channel's ask for a
//!   panel window, cleared only when that panel draws). `console_filters` is
//!   the one shared field: the Console tab and the executable both read and
//!   write it.
//!
//! The type lives in this shared `dylib`, not in the reloadable shell
//! module, so its identity is stable across shell reloads: the reloaded shell
//! registers the same resource type and keeps the value already in the world,
//! context and dock included. A resource whose type the module defined would
//! be reset by every reload - and the context's drop code would then run from
//! an unloaded image.
