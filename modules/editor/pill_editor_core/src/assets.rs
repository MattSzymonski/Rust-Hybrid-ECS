//! The Assets pipeline: the state the create and rename dialogs edit, and the
//! recorded file batches the menus, the dialogs and the scripted channel
//! queue.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`AssetDialog`]: the state the create and rename dialogs edit while one
//!   is open, owned by the session so it survives shell reloads.
//! - The open, submit and cancel helpers every entry point shares - the
//!   menus, the dialog windows and the scripted channel - so each action
//!   takes one path and logs one token set.
//! - The enablement predicates [`can_delete`] and [`can_write_meta`], and the
//!   acting functions [`delete_selection`] and [`write_meta_selection`] that
//!   ask them the same question.
//! - The file actions that queue one recorded [`EditorCommand`] batch each:
//!   [`queue_delete`], [`queue_write_meta`] and [`queue_move`].
//! - [`reveal_target`] and [`reveal_target_in`]: the absolute path a "show in
//!   the file manager" request opens, refused when it would leave the root.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The dialogs are egui windows drawn by the shell. File edits are
//! [`EditorCommand`](crate::EditorCommand)'s asset commands: this module
//! queues them in [`PendingEditorCommands`], and the frame boundary applies
//! them and records them in the undo history. Nothing here changes the world
//! directly. A reveal is the only action that is not a command: it asks the
//! executable to open a folder, so the shell puts the path in the same queue
//! as a plain request.
