//! Polling the editor's state files for changes.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Notice that one of the editor's state files changed without a writer to
//!   hook: the editor's files are also written by hand and by other tools, so
//!   the file's own metadata is the signal ([`FileStamp`]).
//! - Read a file again only when that metadata moved or the regular re-read is
//!   due, and keep its text so a file that did not change costs nothing
//!   ([`StateFileWatch`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A watch re-reads its file when the file's stamp (its modification time and
//! length, see [`FileStamp`]) moved. It also re-reads every
//! [`STATE_FILE_POLL_FRAMES`] frames whatever the stamp says, which catches an
//! edit whose modification time is too coarse to show it. A caller whose apply
//! can fail calls [`StateFileWatch::poll_now`] until it has applied once, so
//! the watch does not need to remember whether the caller applied its last
//! answer.
//!
//! The editor's theme watch keeps a stamp for each file it follows. It looks
//! the theme up again instead of caching a document's text, so
//! [`StateFileWatch`] is not used there.
