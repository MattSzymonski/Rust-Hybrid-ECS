//! The editor's frame boundary: applies the queued commands, walks the undo
//! history, and prunes that history after a reload.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Apply the batches the shell and the scripted channel queued
//!   ([`apply_pending`]). A move or delete carries the shared selection with
//!   it, and a recorded batch becomes one undo step.
//! - Walk the history for `editor.undo` and `editor.redo`
//!   ([`step_history`]). A step is only popped when a command queue exists.
//! - Drop the history entries the current component registry can no longer
//!   resolve ([`prune_history`]), at most once per registry change.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The drain touches only the engine's world resources, so no runner owns it.
//! The native editor and the browser editor call the same functions at their
//! own frame boundary, so a change to the command contract is made once.
//!
//! Everything a caller can observe is a log line. The suites read `engine
//! commands applied`, `command failed`, `history push` and `history undo`;
//! the module also logs `history remap` and `history pruned`. Both editors
//! therefore report an edit the same way.
//!
//! Nothing here names egui, so the module also works in the browser build,
//! where there is no window at all.
