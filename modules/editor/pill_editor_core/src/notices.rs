//! What the host and the editor did, as plain data for the egui shell: toasts
//! and problems.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Define [`EditorNotices`]: the resource the executable writes before the
//!   shell's pass. It holds the toast events and the Problems rows the
//!   executable fills it with.
//! - Define [`Notice`], [`NoticeLevel`] and [`ProblemRow`]: owned strings only.
//! - Name a level the way the toast log lines do, which the suites match
//!   ([`level_name`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! `pill_development_host::HostNotice` says what the host did: a module
//! reloaded or failed, a patch went live or failed, a function rolled back.
//! The executable turns each notice into a toast line, and a failure also into
//! a Problems row for the module or function that failed. The shell only reads
//! this data. The host owns the notice queue, the executable owns this
//! resource, and the shell draws from it. That is why the resource lives in
//! this shared `dylib` rather than in the reloadable shell module: its identity
//! survives a shell reload, and no field may point into a module image that the
//! reload unmaps.
