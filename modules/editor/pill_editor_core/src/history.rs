//! Undo and redo history for editor edits.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Own the undo entries, the cursor that says which of them are applied,
//!   and the redo tail (the entries past the cursor).
//! - Merge continuous edits of one control, such as a slider drag, into a
//!   single step while they keep arriving close together.
//! - Keep the history within the step cap and the memory budget the
//!   preferences set, dropping the oldest entries first and reporting which
//!   limit caused the drop.
//! - Drop entries that name a component type or field a reload removed.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The history is a world resource, so it survives reloads of the editor
//! modules that write into it. An engine entry keeps two batches: the
//! commands that made the edit and the commands that reverse it. Undo pops an
//! entry and queues its inverse batch through the same frame-boundary
//! application every edit uses, so an undo reaches the world the same way the
//! edit did. A restore of a destroyed entity assigns a fresh handle; after it
//! runs, the remaining entries are moved to that handle with
//! [`CommandHistory::remap_entity`].
