//! The egui editor's shared core: the UI libraries it re-exports, the dock
//! layout model and the editor's view of the engine.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Re-export `egui` and `egui_dock` as the one copy the editor's frontend,
//!   its reloadable shell module and this crate all name.
//! - Carry the shell boundary ([`boundary`]) and the module panels a dock tab
//!   names ([`panels`]).
//! - Provide the bridge from the shell's window events to egui's input
//!   ([`input`]), the editor's egui style ([`style`]) and Phosphor's vendored
//!   icon fonts with the icons the chrome paints ([`icons`]).
//! - Own the dock layout: the tab set, the default layout and versioned
//!   persistence through `egui_dock`'s state ([`layout`]).
//! - Own the editor's snapshots of the engine and the commands it applies to
//!   it ([`editor_state`]).
//! - Own the clipboard documents ([`clipboard`]), the transform gizmos
//!   ([`gizmo`]) and the floating viewport toolbox ([`toolbox`]).
//! - Declare the layout persistence failures ([`error`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Nothing here depends on a window or a GPU. The frontend owns the device
//! and draws the shell's frame with `egui-wgpu`, and the shell owns the egui
//! `Context`. `test_engine_layout.py` checks that no windowing or GPU crate is
//! reachable from this one. The crate is a shared `dylib`. The boundary types,
//! the layout and the commands cross between the editor executable and the
//! reloadable shell module, and one compiled copy per process gives them one
//! identity. The module world and the host world must resolve `egui`,
//! `egui_dock` and `epaint` identically, and the manifest pins the union of
//! their features.
//!
//! # The reload-safety contract
//!
//! egui's `Context` keeps arbitrary typed values and callbacks alive past the
//! frame that stored them. Reloadable crates (`extensions/**`,
//! `examples/**`) must never store their own types or closures in it. After a
//! reload, the stored value's drop code and vtable point into the image that
//! was unloaded, so touching the value runs code that is no longer there.
//!
//! The APIs that keep boxed `Any`/`Fn` values inside the context are
//! `Context::data` and `Context::data_mut` (the `IdTypeMap` behind them),
//! `Context::set_request_repaint_callback`, `Context::on_begin_pass` and
//! `Context::on_end_pass` (plugins), and any shape carrying
//! `egui::PaintCallback`. `test_coding_standards.py` flags those calls in
//! reloadable crates. A line that deliberately touches the map carries the
//! `egui-state-ok` marker; only a test may use it, and only to plant a value
//! that a previous generation left behind.
//!
//! Long-lived egui state therefore lives in a world resource defined by this
//! crate: the shell's [`session::EguiShellState`], which a newly loaded shell
//! generation finds in the world and keeps using. The shell clears egui's data
//! map on the first frame of every generation
//! (`pill_editor_shell_egui_editor::shell::claim`), because a value left there
//! by a previous generation would be read through the vtable of an image that
//! is no longer loaded.
