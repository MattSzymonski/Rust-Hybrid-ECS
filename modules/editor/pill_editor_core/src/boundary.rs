//! The plain data the egui frontend and the reloadable egui shell exchange.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`EguiShellInput`]: what the frontend writes for the shell each frame.
//!   That is the window's size and scale, its focus, time and frame rate, the
//!   window's events, the cursor and paste text, and the scene badges.
//! - [`EguiShellFrame`]: what the shell hands back. That is the tessellated
//!   meshes, the texture uploads, the interaction state, the cursor and
//!   clipboard text, the viewport rectangles and the requests the pass raised.
//!   The frontend drains it.
//! - [`frame_from_output`]: builds the frame from egui's own output and drops
//!   paint callbacks, because only plain data crosses the boundary.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Everything that crosses is plain data: no handles, no device objects and no
//! callbacks. The shell's input events travel in [`EguiShellInput`] as owned
//! [`InputEvent`]s, so the UI reads the events of its own windows and never
//! the game's.
