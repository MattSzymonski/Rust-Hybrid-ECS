//! The recovery document: editor state a run saves as it goes, so the next
//! run can bring it back after an abrupt exit.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`RecoveryDocument`]: the dock, the selection and the version stamp,
//!   saved as a JSON document beside the layout file.
//! - [`write`] / [`read`] / [`remove`]: the three operations the editor
//!   executable calls on that file.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The layout file is saved when the editor quits cleanly, and it holds the
//! arrangement the person kept. The recovery file is written while the editor
//! runs and is deleted on a clean exit, so finding it at startup means the
//! last run did not finish. The editor then restores that document, so the
//! person gets back the arrangement they had instead of the default one.
//!
//! The selection is stored as text: entity display handles (`3v0`), the
//! selected asset's project-relative path and the selected resource's stable
//! name. No runtime handle or type id is written, because the document
//! outlives the process that wrote it. The clipboard payload follows the same
//! rule.
