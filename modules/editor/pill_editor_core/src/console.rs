//! The Console tab's history and the filters that narrow it.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Keep the lines the executable captures: owned strings, oldest first,
//!   capped at [`CONSOLE_LINES_MAX`].
//! - Sort every line into the engine channel or the game channel, so a
//!   project's own messages can be read apart from the engine's.
//! - Define the filter state (lowest level shown, search text, channel) that
//!   the shell's tab edits and the scripted channel also sets.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A world resource, filled by the executable each frame from the telemetry
//! capture ring and read by the shell's tab. Every string is owned: the
//! capture ring lives in `pill_core`, but the tab outlives any module image
//! that happened to log a line, and a borrowed target would dangle across a
//! reload.
