//! Editor panels registered by a module.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Hold the panels editor crates register: an id, a title, the crate that
//!   registered it, the function that draws it and a liveness marker.
//! - Tell a live panel from one whose module has been unloaded, so the shell
//!   can never call into an unloaded image.
//! - Give each panel a stable slot, which is what a dock tab stores, and keep
//!   the slot across the registering module's reload.
//! - Carry [`PanelContext`], the plain data a panel reads and the commands it
//!   leaves behind.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`PanelRegistry`] is a world resource the executable inserts and the shell
//! reads each frame. A panel's draw function is a plain `fn` pointer into the
//! registering module's image. The registry hands that pointer out only while
//! the source's marker is alive: the marker's strong count says whether the
//! image is still mapped.
//!
//! Registering is per id, not per crate. A module that reloads registers the
//! same id again, and that replaces the entry in place (a new function, marker
//! and epoch) while the slot stays. A module that unloads and never returns
//! leaves its entry with a dead marker, and the tab says so instead of
//! vanishing.
