//! The editor's command vocabulary and the metadata the history reads.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - List every mutation the editor can queue ([`EditorCommand`]). This is the
//!   one owned type the shell queues and the frame boundary applies.
//! - Answer what the history asks of a command: whether it records, which
//!   component and field identifiers it addresses, and which entity handle it
//!   names ([`EditorCommand::recordable`],
//!   [`EditorCommand::touched_identifiers`], [`EditorCommand::remap_entity`]).
//! - Sort each command into the family whose applier module applies it
//!   ([`CommandFamily`], [`EditorCommand::family`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The command enum stays in one piece because it is the format of the queue
//! the shell fills and the executable drains, so its values cross the reload
//! boundary between the two. Only the applier is split, one module per
