//! The editor's open scene: which `.scene` the world came from, whether it
//! changed since the last save, and the file operations behind New, Open, Save
//! and Save As.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`SceneSession`]: the open scene's path and guid, and the unsaved marker
//!   every undoable command sets. A world resource, so reloading the editor
//!   shell keeps the open document.
//! - [`new_scene`], [`open_scene`], [`write_scene`]: the scene commands behind
//!   New, Open and Save. Open and Save go through the engine's
//!   [`import_scene_document`], [`load_scene`] and [`save_scene`].
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The engine owns serialization; this module owns the document's *identity* -
//! the path it was read from and the guid written into it. Save needs that
//! identity, and the scene title is built from it. Opening or starting a new
//! scene replaces the world, so the command history and the selection go with
//! it. The history's steps and the selection both name entities that the
//! previous document owned.
