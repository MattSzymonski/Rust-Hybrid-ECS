//! Dragging a project asset out to the OS.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`start`]: hands one project asset to OLE as a file drag, so it can be
//!   dropped into Explorer, another editor, or any `CF_HDROP` target.
//! - [`EditorDropSource`]: the drop source that ends the drag when the mouse
//!   button comes up and cancels it on Escape.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The shell cannot start the drag itself. `DoDragDrop`, OLE's drag-and-drop
//! call, runs a modal loop on the thread that calls it, and only this
//! executable depends on the `windows` crate. Instead, the shell reports the
//! asset's path in the frame it hands back, and this module starts the drag
//! from the frame boundary.
//!
//! The path becomes the shell's item list first (a PIDL, a pointer to an item
//! identifier list). `SHCreateDataObject` then wraps that list in a data object
//! which offers the file under `CF_HDROP`, the format a file drop target reads.
//!
//! The drop source always ends the drag instead of keeping it running. It drops
//! the file as soon as the left button is not held, and cancels on Escape.
//! Answering "continue" on a button it could not read would spin the modal loop
//! while the editor's frame stays frozen.
//!
//! The same rule applies before the loop. `DoDragDrop` only asks its drop
//! source whether to continue when input arrives, so a drag started with no
//! button held would leave the editor frozen until more input arrived.
//! [`start`] reads the button first and starts no drag.
//!
//! # Platforms
//!
//! An OLE drag source is what makes a file draggable out of the editor, and it
//! exists on Windows alone. Everywhere else [`start`] answers
//! [`DragOutOutcome::Unsupported`] without starting anything, and the runner
//! logs that once per request; nothing else in the editor is affected. winit
//! offers no drag source on Unix, so a real implementation would have to speak
//! XDND or the Wayland data-device protocol itself, which is why the platform
//! split is here and not in a dependency.
