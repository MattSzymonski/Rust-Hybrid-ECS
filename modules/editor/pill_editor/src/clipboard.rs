//! Writes the editor's payload to the OS clipboard and reads text back from it.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`write`]: put text on the clipboard twice, once in the editor's own
//!   clipboard format and once as plain text, so another editor instance or a
//!   text editor can read it.
//! - [`read`]: return the text the clipboard carries, preferring the editor's
//!   own format and falling back to plain text.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The shell does not touch the OS clipboard. It queues a `ClipboardRequest` on
//! its `EditorClipboard` resource, and the runner carries the request out here
//! at the frame boundary. That way no OS clipboard handle crosses the reload
//! boundary.
//!
//! Each platform carries its own backend below.
//!
//! On Windows the Win32 clipboard is driven directly, and that code lives here
//! because only this executable names the `windows` crate: a shared dylib must
//! never carry its large `raw-dylib` import set. The write path and the read
//! path there both close the clipboard on every path, because a clipboard left
//! open blocks every other process. A read is bounded by the size the clipboard
//! reports for the block (`GlobalSize`), never by the terminator the producer
//! was supposed to write: any process can set the registered format, so a block
//! with no NUL inside its own size is refused and logged instead of being read
//! past its end into this process's heap.
//!
//! Everywhere else the session's own clipboard tool does the work -
//! `wl-copy`/`wl-paste` on Wayland, `xclip` on X11 - which keeps a second
//! clipboard implementation and the display-server libraries one needs out of
//! this crate. The editor's payload *is* the text, so writing it as plain text
//! keeps a paste from another editor decodable, exactly as the Windows path
//! does by writing both formats.
