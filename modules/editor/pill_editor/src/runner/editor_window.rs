//! The editor window's state and the code that opens it.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Hold the state one editor frame reads and writes: the main window and
//!   the editor's GPU device, the host (which owns the project, the world and
//!   the shell session), the scene views and popout windows, the cameras, the
//!   gizmo drag in flight, and the caches the frame keeps.
//! - Create all of it in [`EditorWindow::open`]: the device, the overlay, the
//!   game window, the host with its modules, and the scene views.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The state is one struct because the frame's phases all work on one borrow
//! of it. The methods that use it live in the sibling modules, one per
//! concern. The fields are `pub(super)` so those modules can read them; a
//! getter for each field would only wrap plain data.
