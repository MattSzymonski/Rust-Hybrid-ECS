//! The editor's windows: surfaces, child windows, popouts and presentation.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Create and place each scene view's child window and the game view's, and
//!   keep every renderer surface bound to the window that shows it.
//! - Create and close the popped-out tab windows, and present each tab's frame
//!   in its own window.
//! - Present one editor frame through the overlay, drawing the fallback UI
//!   while no shell module is loaded.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A view's window and its renderer surface are handled together, because a
//! surface only draws into the window it is bound to. Drawing the UI is best
//! effort: the composition overlay is the normal posture, the window's own
//! surface is the fallback, and when the platform refuses both, creating the
//! composition overlay is retried every 120 frames instead of failing.
