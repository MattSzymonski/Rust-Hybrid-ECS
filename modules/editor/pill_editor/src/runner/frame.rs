//! Runs one editor frame as a series of named phases.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Run one editor frame in order: the frame rate sample, input, queued
//!   requests, published resources, the world frame, its answers and the
//!   presentation. Each phase is a method of its own.
//! - Decide when the loop draws next, from the reasons this frame recorded,
//!   and the wake it leaves for the event loop to wait on.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Every phase runs on the same borrow of the window, so splitting them into
//! methods organizes the frame but decouples nothing: each method name says
//! which step it performs, and `frame` is the list of steps in order. The
//! publish-before-run and consume-after-run rule the engine relies on is
//! stated once, in `frame`'s doc.
