//! The editor's composition overlay: the UI layer drawn above the scene's
//! own child window.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`OverlaySurface`]: the DirectComposition target and visual over the
//!   editor window, the `wgpu` surface drawn through it, the size that keeps
//!   the swapchain matching the window, and the gate that skips empty frames.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A flip-model swapchain on the window's `HWND` cannot be transparent over
//! the scene's child window. A DirectComposition visual on a `topmost`
//! target can: the desktop compositor draws it above every child surface, so
//! each overlay pixel blends with the scene through its own alpha. `wgpu`
//! draws into the overlay through `SurfaceTargetUnsafe::CompositionVisual`.
//! Its DX12 backend implements that by setting the swapchain as the visual's
//! content, so the tree is committed after every configure and the visual
//! outlives the surface.
//!
//! The content is the shell's `EguiShellFrame`. `egui-wgpu`'s renderer draws
//! it on the editor's own device with premultiplied alpha (each colour
//! already multiplied by its alpha), which is the form the compositor
//! expects.
//!
//! Only the editor binary creates the DirectComposition device, through the
//! `windows` crate. A shared dylib must not: every hot patch of it would
//! otherwise import `dcomp.dll`.
