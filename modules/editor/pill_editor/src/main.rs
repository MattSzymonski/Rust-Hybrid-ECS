//! Native editor executable: the Pill engine's editor frontend.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Install the engine report handler and the shared telemetry stack.
//! - Own the `winit` event loop, the main window, and the editor's own GPU
//!   device that draws the editor's UI.
//! - Host the project and its extensions, including the reloadable editor
//!   shell module, through `pill_development_host`.
//! - Convert the final error into one styled miette report at the single
//!   reporting boundary.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Nothing in this executable can change while it runs: the shared platform
//! layer, the loop and the UI presentation never reload. Everything that
//! should reload - panels, their commands and their state - lives in the
//! shell module this binary hosts. A change here needs a restart; a change
//! to the shell module hot-patches or reloads.
