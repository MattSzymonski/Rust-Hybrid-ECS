// Managed access to engine resources.
//
// Responsibilities:
// - Declares the [EcsResource] attribute that marks a project's singleton
//   state, and the Res<T>/ResMut<T> system parameters that reach it.
// - Resolves a resource's bytes through the native table, once per access,
//   under the same scope and access-declaration rules queries obey.
//
// Design:
// - A resource is a blittable struct, exactly like a component, and reaches
//   the host through the same manifest: the identity is the hash of the full
//   type name, so the managed declaration and the native registration agree
//   without anything being generated.
// - Res<T> and ResMut<T> carry no state. Every `.Value` re-asks the host for
//   the pointer rather than caching one, which is what makes a stale borrow
//   impossible: there is no borrow to keep. A resource is touched a handful of
//   times per system, not once per row, so the per-access call costs nothing
//   the query data plane would have had to pay.
// - The scheduler learns about resource access the same way it learns about
//   component access: one reflected entry per declared parameter, so two
//   systems that write one resource are serialized rather than raced.

/// The identity across the boundary is the type's full name by default, so it
/// must be unique in the process and is what a save file records. Pass a
