//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The camera is an ordinary scene component. It is shared, so the host, a
//! project and the managed side all see the same one. It is persistable, so its
//! values are saved with a scene and survive a reload. Its shared name is
//! pinned rather than derived from the module path; see [`crate::components`].
//!
//! **Renderer contract.** [`crate::frame::RenderFrame`] carries this camera on
//! every surface it draws through. That is why the component stays in
//! `pill_renderer_api` for every renderer, unlike a renderer's own components,
//! which live in that renderer's data crate.

/// A perspective camera: the renderer builds its projection matrix from it and
/// its view matrix from the transform stored beside it.
///
/// When the renderer picks a camera out of the world, it uses one enabled
/// camera. The highest `priority` wins, and equal priorities go to the lowest
/// entity id, so the choice cannot change with the order the entities are
/// visited. A surface with its own camera binding uses that camera instead.
///
/// A value the projection cannot use is replaced with a default while the
/// renderer builds the matrix. That keeps a mistyped field of view or near/far
/// pair from producing NaN values in the matrix.
