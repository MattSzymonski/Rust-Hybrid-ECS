//! The surfaces one renderer draws into: their identities, how each one
//! presents, and which camera draws into it.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Name a renderer's surfaces ([`SurfaceId`]); the window a renderer is
//!   attached with is [`SurfaceId::PRIMARY`], every other one is attached
//!   through [`crate::PillRenderer::attach_surface`].
//! - Describe how a surface presents ([`SurfaceOptions`], [`PresentPreference`]).
//! - Bind a camera to a surface ([`CameraBinding`], the [`SurfaceCameras`]
//!   resource) and carry each surface's resolved camera in the frame
//!   ([`SurfaceView`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Everything here is plain data, so a frontend, the host and any renderer
//! agree on it without sharing a graphics type. A camera binding either names
//! a camera entity or carries the camera itself. The editor's own camera is
//! the second kind, which keeps it out of the world.
//!
//! The frontend decides when each surface presents, because only it knows the
//! window system. Presenting into a Wayland subsurface before the compositor
//! asks for a frame blocks under Mesa's FIFO mode. So the frontend tells the
//! renderer, for each surface and each frame, whether that surface may present
//! now ([`crate::PillRenderer::set_surface_ready`]), and the renderer skips a
//! surface that may not. One blocked surface never stalls another surface or
//! the event loop.
