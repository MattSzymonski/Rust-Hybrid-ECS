//! The frame the renderer draws: plain data a project's world hands the
//! renderer once per update.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Define [`RenderFrame`], the per-update renderer input, and the two values
//!   it carries: [`RenderInstance`] for each drawable and [`ResolvedPass`] for
//!   each pass of the chain.
//! - Define the vocabulary a resolved pass is written in: [`PassSettings`],
//!   [`PassKind`], [`PassTarget`], [`CullMode`] and [`MaterialParameter`].
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Only the types live here. The system that fills them from the world belongs
//! to the renderer module.
//!
//! The frame crosses the artifact boundary, so it carries plain data only:
//! asset keys instead of handles, and a copy of the camera instead of a
//! borrow. The assets behind those keys are read from the world's
//! `AssetManager` when the frame is drawn, so the frame never copies the asset
//! store.
//!
//! **This module is renderer contract.** `PillRenderer::render` takes a
//! [`RenderFrame`], so everything the frame names has to be available to every
//! renderer and to the host, whichever renderer's data crate a project uses.
//! That is why it depends on nothing in the renderer's own data crate: the pass
//! and parameter types it needs are defined here, and the asset types that use
//! them import them from here. The camera is contract for the same reason. The
//! transform is the engine's.
