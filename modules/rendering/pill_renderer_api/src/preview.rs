//! Asset previews: what an editor asks a renderer to draw
//! off-screen, and the pixels it gets back.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Name the asset one preview draws ([`PreviewAsset`]) and the request that
//!   carries it ([`PreviewRequest`], [`PreviewRequests`]).
//! - Carry the pixels back ([`PreviewImage`], [`PreviewResults`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A preview is asked for through the world, the same way a pick is: the
//! editor writes a request into [`PreviewRequests`], the renderer draws one
//! request per frame into its own small target and reads the pixels back over
//! the following frames, and the frontend moves them into
//! [`PreviewResults`]. Nothing is written to disk, and the editor needs no GPU
//! device of its own.
