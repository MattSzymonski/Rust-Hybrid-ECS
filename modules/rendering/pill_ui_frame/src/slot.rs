//! The world resource a UI producer publishes a frame into and a renderer
//! takes it from.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`UiFrameSlot`]: the world resource holding the newest [`UiFrame`] a UI
//!   producer built. It offers `publish` and `take` for the frame, `is_empty`,
//!   and `clear` to drop a frame but keep its buffers.
//! - `request_texture_resend` and `texture_resend_generation`: the pair a
//!   painter uses to ask for every texture again, and a producer to tell
//!   whether that request is new.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A UI producer and a renderer meet here rather than naming each other. The
//! producer (a project's egui pass) writes what it drew; the renderer takes
//! the frame and draws it. Neither side depends on the other's crate, which
//! lets a project link the game-UI library while the renderer module draws
//! without linking it too. On Windows a single link unit cannot hold two
//! copies of the same third-party graph in different formats.
//!
//! The slot lives beside the data it holds rather than in the engine core, so
//! the core names no UI types. Both sides link this crate, so they share one
//! slot type, and its [`Resource::shared_name`] is pinned. The resource id
//! comes from that name rather than from a per-artifact type id, so the
//! project's DLL and the renderer module reach one resource. A changed name
//! would register a second one.
