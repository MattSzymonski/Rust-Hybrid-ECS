//! The physics example: a stack of boxes falling onto a fixed ground plane.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Spawns one fixed ground plane and a stack of dynamic boxes above it.
//! - Reports the moment the simulation is running, so a headless run can be
//!   checked without a renderer.
//! - Reports where the stack stands every few simulated seconds, which is what
//!   shows the contacts were resolved and what makes a module reload visible.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! `pill_physics` owns the simulation; a project only says what exists. An
//! entity is simulated while it carries a [`RigidBodyComponent`] and a
//! [`ColliderComponent`], and its pose lives in the [`TransformComponent`] every
//! other system already reads.
//!
//! Every line this example writes starts with `[stacked_boxes]`, its folder
//! name. That is the convention the extension-example suite reads: a run passes
//! when the log carries `[<folder name>]`, so a new example states its own name
//! once and never needs an entry in a test.
