//! The two components that describe a physics body and its collider.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declares [`RigidBodyComponent`], the simulation inputs of one entity.
//! - Declares [`ColliderComponent`], the shape and material of one entity.
//! - Registers both with the world, field layout included, so the Inspector
//!   draws real rows and a saved scene restores every value.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Both components hold plain numbers only: no rapier type appears here, so a
//! project, a saved scene and the editor never need rapier in their
//! dependencies. The manager converts these values when it builds a body.
