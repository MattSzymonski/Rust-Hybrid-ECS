//! Pill's rigid-body physics: a rapier world behind engine components.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declares the component, manager and system modules.
//! - Re-exports the vocabulary a project names: the two components, the body
//!   kinds and shapes, and the manager.
//! - Exposes [`register`], the entry point the host calls on every generation
//!   of this module.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! An entity is simulated while it carries a
//! [`RigidBodyComponent`] and a [`ColliderComponent`]. The pose stays in the
//! engine's
//! [`TransformComponent`](pill_engine::TransformComponent): the manager builds
//! a body from it and the sync writes a stepped body's pose back into it, so
//! physics needs nothing from a component the renderer and the editor do not
//! already hold.
//!
//! Every value on the boundary is a plain number. rapier is named only inside
//! the manager and the system, which keeps it out of a project's dependency
//! graph, a saved scene file and the managed mirror.
