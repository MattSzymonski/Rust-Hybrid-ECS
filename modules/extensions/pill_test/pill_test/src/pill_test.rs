//! Minimal extension module: one persistable component and one system.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Defines the `ModuleTest` component and the `module_test_processor` system.
//! - Registers both through the extension ABI when the host loads it.
//! - Keeps its entities filled to a target count across hot reloads.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The crate is a plain `rlib`. The generated `host_module_pill_test` wrapper
//! links it into the `cdylib` that the host stages and loads at runtime, beside
//! the project module and reloaded on its own. All registration work lives in
//! [`register`], a plain Rust function, so the same crate can also be linked
//! statically into a monolithic build. The `extern "C"` exports that
//! `#[pill_module]` emits wrap [`register`]: they catch a panic and turn it
//! into a status code, because a panic that unwound across the module boundary
//! would abort the process.
//!
//! The component is registered as persistable, so its values survive a reload.
//! The reload matches persisted types by name, gives a newly added field its
//! default, and ignores a field the type no longer declares.
