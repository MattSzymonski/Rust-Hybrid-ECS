// The audio scene, managed: one sound from res/, a listener and a playing source.
//
// Responsibilities
// - Load `res/audio/blip.wav` as a `Sound` and spawn a listener and an emitter.
// - Ask the emitter to play on its first frame by setting the component's fields.
//
// Design
// `pill_audio` owns the output device and the system that plays; a project only
// decides what exists. The source is a plain struct: set `Sound` and
// `PlayOnAwake`, and the extension's system turns that flag into a play request
// on its next run. `Enabled` on the listener is set explicitly because a C#
// `default` struct has every field false, while the Rust default is true.
//
// The renderer stays at its default in this project's settings: a managed
// project cannot register a component, and `TransformComponent` - which the
// audio system reads both positions from - comes from the renderer's data
// crate. A headless run still opens no window and no GPU device.
