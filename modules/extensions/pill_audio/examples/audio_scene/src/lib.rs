//! The audio example: one sound, one listener and one source that plays it.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Loads `res/audio/blip.wav` through the asset store.
//! - Spawns the listener the extension hears from and the emitter it plays.
//! - Reports once when the source starts playing, so a headless run can be
//!   checked without a speaker.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! `pill_audio` owns the output device and the system that plays; a project
//! only decides what exists. A listener entity says where the world is heard
//! from, and a source entity says what plays. Both carry a
//! [`TransformComponent`], because the extension reads its positions from
//! there.
//!
//! The source is created with [`AudioSourceComponent::playing`], which sets the
//! flag the extension turns into a play request on its next run. From then on
//! the component is the extension's to write: `is_playing` and `sink` are its
//! answers, and this example only reads them.
//!
//! A machine with no audio output is a supported posture. The extension logs a
//! warning and inserts no manager, the source never starts, and this example
//! still announces that the scene is ready - so the line a headless run waits
//! for does not depend on a device existing.
//!
//! Every line this example writes starts with `[audio_scene]`, its folder name.
//! That is the convention the extension-example suite reads: a run passes when
//! the log carries `[<folder name>]`, so a new example states its own name once
//! and never needs an entry in a test.
