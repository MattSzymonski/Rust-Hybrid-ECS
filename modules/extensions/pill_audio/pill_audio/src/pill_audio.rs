//! The audio extension: sound assets, playback components and the system that
//! plays them.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Defines the [`Sound`] asset: encoded audio bytes held by the
//!   [`AssetManager`](pill_engine::AssetManager) and decoded for each playback.
//! - Defines the [`AudioListenerComponent`] and [`AudioSourceComponent`]
//!   components, and the [`AudioManager`] resource that owns the output stream
//!   and its sink pools.
//! - Registers [`audio_system`], which drives playback on every frame.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! **A sound is an asset, not a resource.** A world holds many sounds, so
//! [`Sound`] implements [`Asset`](pill_engine::Asset) and is referenced by
//! `Handle<Sound>`. The handle carries a generation: after a sound is unloaded,
//! a handle that names it finds nothing, so a component that still holds the
//! handle plays nothing. The asset never has to clear the components that name
//! it.
//!
//! **The audio manager is a resource** because the machine has exactly one
//! output device, and its rodio stream must stay open while any sink plays. A
//! resource lives as long as the world, which is the lifetime the stream needs.
//!
//! **A component records the request; the system performs it.** A caller that
//! edits a component cannot reach the manager, so the requested action is kept
//! as a plain [`AudioCommand`] field and carried out by [`audio_system`]. The
//! component stays `#[repr(C)]` plain data, which is what lets it survive a hot
//! reload and be read from C#.
//!
//! ## Spatial audio
//!
//! A spatial sink places a sound at a 3D point. The transform's
//! [`translation`](pill_engine::TransformComponent::translation) is that point:
//! an emitter follows its entity's translation, and a listener's ears are
//! placed around the listener's own translation.
//!
//! [`AudioListenerComponent`] keeps its own `facing_degrees` instead of reading
//! the transform's quaternion, and [`ear_positions`] is the one function that
//! turns a listener's placement into the two points rodio pans against.
