//! The [`AudioManager`] resource: the audio output device and its sink pools.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Owns the rodio output stream. The stream must stay open while any sound
//!   plays through it, because dropping it stops every sound.
//! - Hands out a sink from one of two fixed pools, one pool per [`SoundType`],
//!   and takes it back when the sound using it ends.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! There is exactly one audio device. A value a system builds per frame would
//! be dropped at the end of that frame, which silences the sound it just
//! started, so the device lives in a resource instead.
//!
//! The sinks are pooled instead of created on demand. Creating one makes rodio
//! allocate a mixer channel, and doing that while a frame is being built would
//! put an allocation on the audio path, which must not stall. The size of a
//! pool is therefore also the limit on how many voices play at once.
