//! The per-frame system driving every [`AudioSourceComponent`].
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Turns queued [`AudioLoadQueue`] bytes into [`Sound`] assets.
//! - Places the active listener's ears.
//! - Carries out each source's pending [`AudioCommand`].
//! - Moves each playing spatial source's emitter to its entity, and returns
//!   sinks whose sound has ended to the pool.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Takes its state as ordinary system parameters instead of `&mut Engine`.
//! The scheduler reads the access pattern from the signature, so it never
//! runs this system at the same time as another one that touches the same
//! resources.

/// Drives every [`AudioSourceComponent`] once per frame.
///
/// Queued sound loads become [`Sound`] assets first. Then four steps run, in
/// this order:
///
/// 1. the active listener's ears are placed, so panning matches this frame;
/// 2. each source's pending [`AudioCommand`] is carried out;
/// 3. each playing spatial source's emitter is moved to its entity;
/// 4. sinks whose sound has finished are returned to the pool.
///
/// Step 4 is what makes a fixed pool workable. Without it, a source would keep
/// its sink after its sound ended, and the pool would run out of voices.
///
/// With no [`AudioManager`] installed the function only drains the load
/// queue, which is the headless case. See [`AudioManager::new`].
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`SystemError::Failure`] when the asset store refuses to store a
/// queued sound under its name. The name is checked first, so this is not
/// expected to happen.
