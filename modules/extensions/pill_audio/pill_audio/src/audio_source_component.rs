//! The [`AudioSourceComponent`] component: an entity that plays a sound.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declares the component that holds the intent to play, plus the playback
//!   state [`audio_system`](crate::audio_system) writes back to it.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Every field is plain data, so the component survives a hot reload and can
//! be mirrored into C#. The sound is held as a [`Handle<Sound>`], the same way
//! a mesh or a material is referenced. A handle is `#[repr(C)]` two-integer
//! data with no allocation, so it crosses the module boundary safely. It also
//! names one loaded sound, so playing it needs no path lookup.
