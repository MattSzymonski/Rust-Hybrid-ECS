//! An example extension with no ECS state. It provides a colour value type and
//! an alpha function that can be hot-patched.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Defines [`Tint`] with its two colour methods and the [`grayscale`] free
//!   function.
//! - Exposes [`get_color_a`], hot-patchable and mirrored to C# as
//!   `pill_dummy_color.PillDummyColor.GetColorA()`.
//! - Declares [`Tint`] and [`TestStruct`] as value types, and mirrors
//!   `TestStruct::aaa` with a `pill_mirror_method` marker written with its full
//!   path. Together they cover the three shapes the code generator handles: a
//!   free function, a value type and a mirrored method.
//! - Registers through the extension ABI when the host loads it.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The crate carries no ECS state. [`register`] is a no-op that only reports
//! success, and it stays a plain Rust function so the same crate can also be
//! linked statically into a monolithic build. `pill_spline` depends on it, and
//! the managed C# fixture in `devops/tests/projects/managed` loads it as a
//! module.

// External crates
// `pill_module` and `Engine` must be available in every build, because the
// attribute is written on `register` here and `register` is compiled
// everywhere.
use pill_engine::{pill_hot_fn, pill_mirror_fn, pill_module, PillMirror};
use pill_engine::{pill_mirror_impl, Engine};

// The build script scans this crate and writes one address entry per function
// into `function_inventory.rs`. Including that file is what lets the host find
// each function by its qualified path, with nothing annotated in this source.
