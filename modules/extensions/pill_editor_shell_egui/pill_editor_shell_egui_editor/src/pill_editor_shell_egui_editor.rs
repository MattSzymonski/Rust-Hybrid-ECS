//! The egui editor shell: the docked UI that reloads while the editor runs.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Registers the shell's session state and the boundary resources, and the
//!   per-frame system that runs the dock ([`egui_shell_update`]).
//! - Re-claims every resource on every load, so a reload keeps the dock
//!   layout, the egui context and the shared selection.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The executable owns the window, the GPU device and the input. This crate
//! owns the dock and the egui pass, and the two exchange plain data
//! ([`EguiShellInput`], [`EguiShellFrame`]) in the `pill_editor_core` dylib
//! both link. The shell turns that input into egui's own raw input.
//!
//! This file holds the crate's hot system. To patch [`egui_shell_update`],
//! the hot-patch machinery copies it into a crate of its own and replays this
//! file's top-level `use` lines there. Everything the system calls therefore
//! has to be `pub` in [`shell`] and reachable by its package path, because a
//! helper declared in this file does not exist in the patch crate.
//!
//! An edit in `shell.rs` is patched the same way. That patch crate replays the
//! file's `use` lines and adds `use pill_editor_shell_egui_editor::*;` on top,
//! and the glob reaches this module's items, which is why the shell's public
//! items are re-exported below. Without the re-export, a tab body's bare-name
//! call to a sibling would not resolve, and the edit would fall back to a
//! reload.

// The crate's own name, so the `pub use` below resolves inside this crate
// too. A generated patch crate replays the same `use` lines; there the name
// is the linked crate itself.
