//! The shell's claim on egui's shared contexts.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`claim_shell_context`]: the per-generation wrapper `run_frame` calls
//!   before its pass. It applies the once-per-generation rule kept in this
//!   file, and gets the actual clearing from the session that owns the
//!   contexts.
//! - [`claim_context_once`]: the same rule for a single context, with the
//!   flag passed in instead of read from this file's static.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The egui `Context` lives in the session, a world resource whose type the
//! shared model crate defines, and the frontend that keeps the world never
//! unloads. So the context survives a shell reload. egui's `Memory::data` map
//! can still hold values the previous generation created: a scroll position,
//! a text editor's cursor, the dock's own saved state. Such a value also
//! carries drop code and a vtable from the generation that created it. After
//! a reload those point into an image that is no longer loaded, so touching
//! the value is a use-after-unmap.
//!
//! The first frame of every generation therefore clears every context the
//! session owns, main and popped-out alike
//! ([`EguiShellState::claim_generation`](pill_editor_core::session::EguiShellState::claim_generation)).
//! Widget-local state that egui keeps in that map goes with it. That loss is
//! acceptable, because keeping such state is not worth the risk of reading a
//! pointer into an unloaded image. Long-lived UI state lives in the session
//! itself, a world resource the shared model crate defines, which is what
//! makes it safe across generations.
//!
//! The "already claimed" flag is a `static` of this crate, and a static lives
//! in the module's own image. Every generation therefore starts unclaimed,
//! and later frames of the same generation do nothing. That is also why the
//! flag cannot move to the model with the clearing: the model outlives the
//! generation whose claim it would be.
