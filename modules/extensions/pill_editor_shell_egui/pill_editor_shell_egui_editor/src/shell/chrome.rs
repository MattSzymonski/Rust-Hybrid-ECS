//! The chrome the shell's tabs share: tab icons, the selection moves, the
//! context menus and the rectangles the frame reports as the UI's.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`tab_icon`]: the icon a dock tab draws beside its title.
//! - [`paint_active_tab_underline`]: the accent line under the active tab's
//!   name, which the dock does not draw itself.
//! - The selection moves the tabs and the scene viewports make, each logging
//!   the token a suite watches for.
//! - [`apply_tab_redock`]: puts a floating surface's tabs back into the dock.
//! - [`empty_area`]: the empty strip under a panel's rows, where its menu
//!   opens.
//! - [`claim_pointer`], [`mark_menu_region`], [`context_menu`] and
//!   [`floating_popup`]: the rectangles a menu or a popup claims, so a click
//!   on it is never a scene pick.
//! - [`engine_badge`]: the mark on a picker row whose asset comes from the
//!   engine rather than the project.
//! - [`remember_moved_rect`]: the once-per-placement logging the Inspector's
//!   sections and the scene viewports' badges use.
//!
//! The globs below are absolute paths, so a patch crate resolves them too.
