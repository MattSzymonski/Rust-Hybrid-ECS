//! The editor's shared row layout: a fixed label column, then the row's
//! control.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`ROW_LABEL_WIDTH`] and [`WIDE_ROW_LABEL_WIDTH`]: the two label columns,
//!   the same in every tab that uses them, so the controls down a panel line
//!   up at one x.
//! - [`row`] and [`row_in`]: one label and the control beside it, the default
//!   way a field is drawn.
//! - [`label_cell`] and [`label_cell_in`]: the label alone, for a row whose
//!   control is a wrapped or nested run the tab builds by hand.
//! - [`label_gap`]: the rest of the space after that label cell, which a tab
//!   drawing such a row adds itself.
//! - [`value_row`] and [`value_row_in`]: a read-only row whose control is the
//!   value in monospace text.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A row is a layout, never a fill: no row paints a background, so the panel's
//! own surface shows through and rows are never striped.
//!
//! The label cell has a fixed width and starts its text at the cell's left
//! edge. That keeps a panel's labels in one column, and a label too long for
//! its column is cut off inside it instead of pushing its neighbours aside.
//!
//! A row leaves at least [`ROW_LABEL_GAP`] points between the label and its
//! control, whatever item spacing the panel uses. Rows place standard widgets
//! at their usual heights.
//!
//! A panel whose labels are field names takes the compact column
//! ([`ROW_LABEL_WIDTH`]); a panel whose labels are whole setting names takes
//! the wide one ([`WIDE_ROW_LABEL_WIDTH`]).
//!
//! The globs below spell absolute paths on purpose: a generated patch crate
//! replays this file's top-level `use` lines, and a `super::`-relative glob
//! would have nothing to point at there.
