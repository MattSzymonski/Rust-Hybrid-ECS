//! Reading the pick buffer back without stalling a frame.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Copy each requested pixel of the pick buffer into a buffer the CPU can
//!   map ([`PickReadback::copy_requested_pixels`]).
//! - Ask for those buffers to be mapped once the frame that filled them is
//!   submitted, then turn what they hold into answers
//!   ([`PickReadback::collect`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A frame records the copies and never waits for them. The map is asked for
//! after the frame is submitted, and a later [`PickReadback::collect`] polls
//! the device without blocking and decodes whatever has arrived.
//!
//! A pixel that covers a mesh holds that instance's position in the frame's
//! draw queue, so each readback keeps the entity at every queue position of
//! the frame it came from. The answer stays right even when a later frame
//! draws the queue in another order.
