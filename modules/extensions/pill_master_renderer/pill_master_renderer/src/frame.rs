//!
//! - Collect the frame from the world each update: the camera to draw through,
//!   every drawable the world offers, and the clock the shaders read
//!   ([`rendering_system`]).
//! - Turn the game's pipeline into plain passes. Entries that are switched off
//!   or point at dead assets are left out, and a chain whose surface pass
//!   breaks the renderer's contract is reported in the log.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`RenderFrame`], [`RenderInstance`] and [`ResolvedPass`] are plain data
//! from `pill_renderer_api`, re-exported here. Filling them is renderer
//! behaviour, so it lives in this module, where a renderer reload can replace
//! it. The system also makes choices the world data does not spell out: which
//! of several cameras to use, what each pipeline pass turns into, and the draw
//! order each instance carries.
