//! What one material becomes on the GPU: the bind groups its draws bind.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Build the two bind groups a material's draws bind, following the slots
//!   its shader declares ([`RendererMaterial`]). Parameters go to group 2 and
//!   textures to group 3.
//! - Pack the material's parameter values, one 16-byte slot each, in
//!   declaration order. A pass packs through the same two functions, so a
//!   material and a pass cannot hand a shader different layouts.
//! - Fall back to the renderer's default texture for a slot's type, and
//!   refuse a depth slot: depth belongs to a pass, the only thing that can
//!   supply it. A texture whose view shape (2D or cube) differs from its
//!   slot's is refused with the slot named in the error.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A material is built during asset sync, when its own content version moves,
//! and never per frame: a frame only binds what is already built. When the
//! shader or a texture a material names is rebuilt, the material is rebuilt
//! too, because the sync drops the version record of every material whose
//! shader or texture changed. The struct keeps the bind groups and never the
//! uniform buffer: a bind group holds what it references, so the buffer lives
//! exactly as long as the group that reads it.
