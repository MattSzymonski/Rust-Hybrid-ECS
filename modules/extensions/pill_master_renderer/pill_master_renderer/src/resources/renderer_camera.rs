//! The camera values the shaders read, and the GPU resources that carry them.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Pack the camera's position, view-projection matrix and inverse
//!   view-projection matrix into the layout the shaders' `CameraParams`
//!   constant buffer expects ([`CameraParametersData`]).
//! - Replace each projection input that no perspective matrix can use, and
//!   name it in the report: a field of view outside `(0, 180)`, a near plane
//!   that is not positive, a far plane at or inside the near one. Without
//!   this, a matrix full of NaN values draws a blank frame with nothing to
//!   trace it to.
//! - Own the uniform buffer and the bind group that every shader reading the
//!   camera binds ([`RendererCamera`]).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The value and the GPU objects are separate: [`CameraParametersData`] is the
//! `#[repr(C)]` layout the shaders read, and [`RendererCamera`] is the buffer
//! and the bind group that hold it. The matrices are rebuilt from the camera
//! and transform components on every update instead of being tracked, so a
//! moved entity is always followed. The same pass replaces the projection
//! inputs that cannot be used and reports what it replaced. A replacement is
//! reported once per change rather than once per frame, so a value the game
//! never fixes does not fill the log.
