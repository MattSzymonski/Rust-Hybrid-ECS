//! The world resource that holds the pipeline the renderer runs.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Hold one optional pipeline handle, and nothing else. It is the pipeline
//!   the renderer should run: the game's choice, or the default that
//!   [`crate::register`] installs.
//! - Cross the module boundary: a project DLL sets the pipeline, the host's
//!   renderer executes it, and both sides have to agree on one resource.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`crate::register`] inserts this resource when it is missing, so it exists
//! before any project code runs and code that sets a pipeline finds it already
//! there. The resource id the host binary and a project DLL both use is the
//! shared name that `#[pill_mirror_resource]` gives the type; `RenderFrame`
//! shares its id the same way. Without a shared name the renderer would read a
//! resource the project never wrote. C#'s generated `RenderingManager` marker
//! carries the same name, so a managed system declares
//! `ResMut<RenderingManager>` and calls `Clear()`.
