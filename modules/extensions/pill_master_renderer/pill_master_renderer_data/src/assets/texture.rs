//! Texture assets: the texels the renderer uploads, and how they are read.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Hold one texture's texels, their dimensions, and the name the asset is
//!   known by.
//! - Say how those texels are read ([`TextureType`]): as colour, as a normal
//!   map, or as an environment (an equirectangular panorama or a cubemap) for
//!   a skybox.
//! - Build a texture by decoding an image file ([`Texture::new`]), from an
//!   RGBA8 buffer ([`Texture::from_rgba`]), or from linear float texels
//!   ([`Texture::from_rgba_f32`]). A cubemap built this way is projected onto
//!   its six faces with the direction convention the skybox shaders sample
//!   by.
//! - Read the import settings from a metadata file ([`ImportedAsset`]):
//!   [`TextureImportSettings`] in `<image>.meta` says how to read the texels.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A texture here is plain data with no GPU state: the renderer keeps the
//! texture, view and sampler beside it and rebuilds them when the asset's
//! version changes. [`TextureType`] travels with the texels because the bytes
//! alone do not say how to read them. The type decides the texel layout, the
//! GPU format the texture is uploaded as, and how a shader may sample it.
//!
//! An environment texture holds high dynamic range values, so it is stored as
//! half floats: the widest format every backend can filter. A cubemap is
//! projected from its panorama once, at import, instead of on every frame.
