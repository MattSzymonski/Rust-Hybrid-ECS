//! An ordered list of passes, as one asset.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Hold the passes a frame runs, in the order the game wrote them, each with
//!   this chain's own switch for it ([`PipelinePass`]).
//! - Stay a list of handles rather than a copy of the passes, so one pass can
//!   appear in several pipelines and editing a pass does not duplicate it.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! This asset is only the declaration. The renderer builds the chain from it -
//! ordering the passes, resolving the targets they name, creating the GPU
//! pipelines - because it owns the device. The game picks the pipeline by
//! setting it on `RenderingManager`, and the renderer builds the chain again
//! whenever that pipeline or the assets change.
//!
//! The asset is also a file of its own (`.pipeline`), so the editor can create
//! one and a project can load one by path. Its body names the passes it runs,
//! in the order they run, and each entry has an optional `enabled` key. That
//! lets one chain leave a pass out while another chain naming the same pass
//! still runs it. The pass's own `enabled` key cannot do that, because it
//! applies to every chain.
//!
//! Nothing else belongs here. A pass already carries the shader it draws with
//! and the values it reads, so a pipeline that also listed shaders and textures
//! would repeat them - and would be out of date as soon as a pass was edited.
//! What the built-in pipelines' `install` functions put in the store is their
//! own business; `AssetManager::handle_by_name` finds an asset by name.
