//! Shader assets and their material binding declarations.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Carry a shader's two WGSL stages plus the uniform and texture slots its
//!   source declares, under the names the source gives them.
//! - Keep those slots in declaration order: that order is the order their
//!   values pack into the uniform buffer, and reordering them would leave the
//!   packed layout disagreeing with the shader's own declarations.
//! - Offer both ways in: [`ShaderBuilder::with_vertex_source`] reads the stages
//!   from files when the shader is built, and [`ShaderBuilder::with_wgsl`] takes
//!   sources already in memory, which is how a chain embeds the stages it ships
//!   and how the C# bridge hands over stages a project supplies.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`ShaderBuilder`] exists because reading the sources is the one step that
//! can fail: the builder collects the parts in any order and
//! [`ShaderBuilder::build`] reads the two stages, so a half-built shader is
//! never alive. The slots are the meeting point with the material side of the
//! renderer, which walks them in declaration order, by name, to size the
//! uniform buffer and place each value.
