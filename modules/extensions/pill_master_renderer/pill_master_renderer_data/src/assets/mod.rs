//! Game-facing renderer assets stored in the world's `AssetManager`.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Own the asset types a project draws from - [`Mesh`], [`Texture`],
//!   [`Shader`], [`Material`], [`RenderPass`], [`RenderingPipeline`] - and
//!   re-export them flat, so a game names them without their submodule.
//! - Carry each type's builder and binding declarations: [`MaterialBuilder`],
//!   [`ShaderBuilder`], the parameter and texture slot types, and the helpers
//!   that key slot lists by the names they carry.
//! - Register every asset type behind `dyn Asset`, the bound every
//!   `AssetManager` method asks for, so the store holds as many of each as a
//!   game wants.
//! - Provide [`asset_key`], which packs a handle's index and generation into
//!   the `u64` the renderer's caches use as their key.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Each asset type is plain data plus a declaration. A game builds it, the
//! `AssetManager` owns it, and the renderer reads it while building a frame.
//! The GPU side - caches, pipelines and bind groups - lives in the GPU module
//! (`pill_master_renderer`), which links this crate. [`asset_key`] puts a
//! handle's generation above its index, so one `u64` tells a cache which asset
//! is meant and which version of it a resource was built from.
