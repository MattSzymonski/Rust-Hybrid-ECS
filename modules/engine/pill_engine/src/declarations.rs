//! The systems, resources and assets an artifact declares, as opposed to the
//! ones it registers by hand.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declare the descriptor types the `#[system]` attribute and the
//!   `#[derive(PillResource)]`/`#[derive(PillAsset)]` derives submit into
//!   [`inventory`], and the collections themselves.
//! - Turn those collections into registered systems, declared resources and
//!   declared asset types at the artifact's entry point, in a deterministic
//!   order.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! This is the shape [`component_registry`](crate::component_registry) gives
//! components, applied to systems, resources and assets. A macro submits one
//! descriptor per declaration into a process-wide collection, and the entry
//! point walks that collection once per generation.
//!
//! The collection is shared by every image mapped in the process: it lives in
//! the engine dylib the artifacts link, and a hot reload keeps the retired
//! images mapped so their pointers stay valid. The entry point therefore keeps
//! only the declarations an image added after the [`DeclarationBaseline`]
//! taken before it was loaded, so a new generation registers its own
//! declarations and never the retired generation's. A static build and a test
//! binary register everything.
//!
//! Registration order decides the order conflicting systems run in, and
//! `inventory` order is link order rather than source order. The system
//! descriptor therefore carries an explicit order key and a name to break
//! ties, so the schedule a project gets is the schedule its declarations
//! describe. Resources and asset types have no execution order; they are
//! declared sorted by type name so the claim order is the same in every build.
