//! The per-DLL registries for components, value types, mirrored methods, field
//! accessors and named exports.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Re-export the engine core's field layouts
//!   (`pill_engine_core::component_registry`) under this path.
//! - Declare the descriptor types the derive and attribute macros submit into
//!   [`inventory`] collections, and the collections themselves.
//! - Provide the artifact-wide registration loop, the schema fingerprint of
//!   the persistable components, and the readers the module/project
//!   entry-point macros and the host call.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! There is one registry per linked artifact. Every binary and every
//! hot-reload generation DLL carries its own collection, holding exactly the
//! components its own sources declared with `#[derive(PillComponent)]`. That
//! is what makes the registry safe across hot reload: a new generation's
//! `init` sees only the components that generation declares, so a type a
//! newer build stops declaring is never registered again from a stale copy,
//! and an evicted generation DLL takes its descriptors with it.
//!
//! It is per artifact because this crate is: `pill_engine` is compiled into
//! every DLL, while the engine core holds only what is the same for all of
//! them. When the core needs something only a collection knows - a value
//! type's layout - the calling DLL passes it in.
//!
//! Registration order is unspecified (linker/initializer order), and that
//! does no harm: component registration is keyed by `TypeId` and is idempotent.
