//! The registries for hot-patching, one copy per DLL: `#[pill_hot]`
//! functions, `#[pill_hot_fn]` slots, and the address inventory a crate's
//! build script writes.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Re-export the engine core's hot-patch machinery
//!   (`pill_engine_core::hot_patch`) under this path, so one import gives a
//!   caller the core's slots and the registries declared here.
//! - Declare the registries the macros and the build-script inventory submit
//!   into ([`PillHotSlotDescriptor`], [`PillFunctionAddress`],
//!   [`PillHotFunctionDescriptor`]) and the functions that read them.
//! - Hold the two helpers the generated resolver exports share:
//!   [`with_qualified_name`], which decodes the export's C-string argument,
//!   and [`write_signature_out`], which writes a signature through the
//!   export's out-parameters.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! These registries answer questions about one DLL, such as where a function's
//! address is in this artifact. That is why they live here, in the crate every
//! DLL compiles in, and not in the engine core, of which there is one copy per
//! process. Each DLL's copy of the functions here reads only the lists that
//! DLL submitted.

// External crates
/// The core's hot-patch machinery, which is the same in every DLL: dispatch
/// slots, the engine-owned patch registry, signature hashing, prologue
/// patching, and the errors all of them report.
