//! Integration tests for resources that keep one identity across artifacts.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Pin that one shared resource name binds two distinct types to one value.
//! - Pin the guards: a refused claim or removal leaves the stored value and
//!   its claim untouched, and a rolled-back reload keeps it readable.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! One resource type compiled into two artifacts gets two `TypeId`s, and a
//! single test binary cannot produce that. Two distinct Rust types that
//! declare the same shared name stand in, because that is what the engine
//! sees in the real case. As in the real case, they live in modules and keep
//! the type's own name: `Settings` is `Settings` in whichever artifact
//! compiled it, and only the module path differs.
//!
//! The cross-artifact behaviour itself is covered end to end by
//! `devops/tests/test_shared_component_identity.py`. This file covers the
//! scheduler at five levels: the pairwise answer (`conflicts_with`), the live
//! sets that answer reads, the batching decision built on it
//! (`SystemScheduler::ensure_execution_graph`), the rebuild a reload takes,
//! and the running engine, where two systems batched together would trip the
//! debug write lock.
