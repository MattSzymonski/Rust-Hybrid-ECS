//! Integration tests for the systems an artifact declares with `#[system]`.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Prove a declared system reaches the engine from the artifact entry point,
//!   with the display name and order its declaration asks for.
//! - Prove the post-update flag puts a system in the later stage.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The declarations are collected by the `pill_engine` copy linked into this
//! test binary, which is the same shape a project or a module has, so calling
//! `run_artifact_registration` here exercises the real path. One frame is run
//! to observe the order the systems execute in. Every declared system writes
//! to one resource, so they conflict and the scheduler must run them one after
//! another in registration order; independent systems would run as one
//! parallel batch and the observation would say nothing about order.
//!
//! A loaded artifact shares its declaration collection with the images already
//! mapped in the process, so the host takes a baseline before mapping it. The
//! last test walks from such a baseline and proves the declarations in front of
//! it stay unregistered, which is what keeps a reloaded generation from
//! registering the retired generation's systems a second time.
