//! A resource declared with `#[derive(PillResource)]` is declared by the
//! artifact entry point, with no call from the artifact.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Prove that a derived resource is declared before the artifact's `register`
//!   half runs, and that storing a value afterwards still works.
//! - Prove that a manager resource declares its settings-asset surface from its
//!   own `register`, which runs on every generation.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The world stamps every resource registration with a sequence number, so the
//! test captures the sequence before the entry point runs and asks which ids
//! were declared since. That observes the declaration itself rather than the
//! value, which `insert_resource` would store either way.
