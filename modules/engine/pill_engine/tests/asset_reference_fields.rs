//! Proves that `#[derive(PillComponent)]` records the asset type each
//! [`Handle`] field references.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Prove the derive's generated registration records each handle field's
//!   asset type: `T`'s shared name, or its Rust type name when it has none.
//!   A read of the field then reports that type, and a write refuses an asset
//!   of another type.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The components are registered through the same loop a module's `init`
//! uses, which registers every component the DLL declares. The derive's
//! generated registration therefore does the recording, not a hand-written
//! call.
