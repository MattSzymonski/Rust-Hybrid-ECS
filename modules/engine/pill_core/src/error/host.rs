//! The error type of every host subsystem, and the root that combines them.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declare the error each subsystem returns: configuration, build, library
//!   loading, extension loading, the file watcher, and the C# backend.
//! - Combine them into [`HostError`] with transparent `#[from]` wrappers, so
//!   `?` works across a subsystem boundary and the original error plus its
//!   source chain survive.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Every subsystem variant carries one `#[message(...)]` definition. The
//! `#[engine_error]` macro turns that definition into the plain `Display`
//! text, a stable `namespace::variant` code, and the [`EngineMessage`]
//! implementation that renders the same definition with semantic roles. No
//! variant names a colour, a glyph or any other way of showing a message.
