//! Tracy profiling: zones, plots and messages behind compile-time feature
//! gating.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Provide the macros call sites use: `profile_scope!`,
//!   `profile_frame_mark!`, `profile_plot!` and the rest.
//! - Compute the parallel-utilization metrics of a frame.
//! - Compile every entry point away to a no-op when no profiling feature is
//!   enabled.
//!
//! # Design

//! | Capability                                   | `profiling` | `profiling-minimal` |
//! |----------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
//! | CPU zones, frame marks, secondary frames     | +           | +                   |
//! | Call stack sampling, on-demand collection    | +           | +                   |
//! | Zone text, native plots, messages, threads   | +           | -                   |
//! | Context switches, system info, code transfer | +           | -                   |
//!
//! A zone is recorded only when the telemetry builder installed its Tracy
//! lane (`TelemetryBuilder::with_tracy`) and a profiler is connected; until
//! then every call returns without recording anything. `profile_init!()`
//! creates the shared client handle. With no profiling feature at all, every
//! entry point is a no-op stub the compiler drops.
