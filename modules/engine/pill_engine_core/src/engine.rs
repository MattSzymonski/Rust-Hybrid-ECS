//! System registration, frame processing and parallel dispatch.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Registers systems by name and enables or disables them.
//! - Runs the frame: the update systems in parallel batches, then the command
//!   flush, then the post-update systems.
//! - Limits the frame rate through `set_fps_limit`.
//! - Measures how long each system takes, for profiling and utilization
//!   metrics.
//! - Provides `world()` and `world_mut()` for queries outside the frame.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The engine owns the [`World`], the [`SystemScheduler`] and the
//! [`CommandQueue`]. A frame bumps the world tick, runs the update systems
//! from the scheduler's batches (in parallel on Rayon threads), then applies
//! the commands the systems queued and runs the post-update systems on the
//! result. A system that uses [`Commands`] always runs alone, because it
//! needs exclusive access to the world.
//!
//! The engine is the only owner of the registered systems, and each record
//! carries the access pattern the scheduler builds its conflict data from.
//! Any structural change - a registration, a removal, a clear - marks the
//! scheduler's graph as out of date; the next frame rebuilds the batches
//! once, before it dispatches.
