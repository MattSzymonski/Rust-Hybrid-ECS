//! Metadata files beside an asset's source, and loading an asset through one.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Name the metadata file of a source asset ([`metadata_path_for`]): the
//!   source's normalized path with `.meta` appended.
//! - Define what an asset type needs to be loaded through its metadata
//!   ([`ImportedAsset`]): import settings and a decoder that takes them.
//! - Own the import pipeline on [`AssetManager`]: [`AssetManager::import`],
//!   [`AssetManager::reimport`], [`AssetManager::ensure_metadata`] and
//!   [`AssetManager::follow_move`].
//! - Hold the file-name rule every editor's create dialog shares
//!   ([`standalone_file_name`]): which base names and characters Windows
//!   refuses. It lives here so every editor builds the same name, and a
//!   standalone asset file is the usual user.
//! - Hold the path check every tool-side asset path goes through
//!   ([`checked_relative`]): relative, inside the asset directory, and not
//!   empty.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A source file in a project's `res` directory (`textures/helmet.jpg`) can
//! carry a metadata file beside it. It holds what the source does not say for
//! itself: the asset's stable guid and its import settings. It never holds
//! the decoded payload. The metadata name keeps the source's extension
//! instead of replacing it, so `helmet.png` and `helmet.obj` get different
//! metadata files, and a `.meta` file is never an asset itself.
//!
//! The file is JSON with a small header the engine owns and the settings the
//! asset type owns:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "format_version": 1,
//!   "asset_type": "pill_master_renderer::assets::Texture",
//!   "guid": "9c0e4b7a1f2d3e4c5b6a798812345678",
//!   "settings": { "texture_type": "Normal" }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! An asset loaded this way is named by its normalized path relative to `res`
//! and keyed by the guid in its metadata. One path is one asset, which is what
//! a project reload needs when it runs its loading code again. A guid claimed
//! by a second path (a source copied together with its `.meta`) is refused
//! rather than silently moved, because the store would otherwise rebind it.
//!
//! Nothing here stores a function pointer: [`AssetManager::import`] is generic,
//! so each call is compiled into the binary that makes it and a reload has
//! nothing to re-point. Code that does not know an asset's type goes through
//! [`ImportRegistry`](crate::asset_import_registry::ImportRegistry), which does
//! store function pointers and handles the reload hazard that comes with them.
