//! The startup scene: the `.scene` file a project's settings name, loaded as
//! soon as the project's component types exist.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - [`StartupScene`]: the request. The front end queues it from the project's
//!   settings, and the project's entry point takes it out of the world and
//!   loads it.
//! - [`apply_startup_scene`]: the load itself.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A project's `init` fills its world up to the counts it expects, so a scene
//! loaded after it would double every entity. A scene loaded before the
//! components are registered would find no component types to attach. The
//! generated project entry point therefore loads this request right after
//! registering the project's components and before its `init`. A shipping
//! build loads it in the same place, inside the project's entry point and
//! after its modules.
//!
//! A managed (C#) project registers its components inside `start`, so it gets
//! the scene once `start` has returned - the earliest point at which its
//! component types exist.
//!
//! A load that fails is logged and not passed back: a missing or unreadable
//! scene must not stop a project from starting with its own scene.
