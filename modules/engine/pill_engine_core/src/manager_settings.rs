//! Settings assets that configure manager resources: the bindings, the readers
//! and the change detection.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Binds a manager resource to the settings asset it reads, defaulting to the
//!   conventional `settings/<name>.<extension>` path.
//! - Reports which managers have no settings file yet, with the bytes a host
//!   writes to create one from the document defaults.
//! - Reads a settings asset's bytes, applies them through the manager's typed
//!   applier, and re-applies when the bytes change.
//! - Turns every failure into one sentence naming the manager, the path and the
//!   reason, so a host logs it once.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The module never writes a file: creating one needs the project's `res`
//! directory, which only a host knows, so a host asks
//! [`World::missing_manager_settings`] for the bytes and writes them. Reading
//! goes through the asset store, so a packed build answers exactly like a
//! directory does.
//!
//! Change detection is a fingerprint of the bytes last applied, not a
//! modification time and not an asset content version. A settings file may be
//! reimported without the world ever seeing a handle, and a shipped pack has no
//! modification time at all.
//!
//! # Related
//!
//! - `settings` - the manager traits and the per-type applier tables.
//! - `asset_standalone` - the standalone files a settings asset is stored as.
