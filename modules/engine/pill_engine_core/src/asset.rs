//! Many-per-type asset storage, addressed by generational handle.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Defines the [`Asset`] marker trait for types stored many-per-type.
//! - Provides [`Handle<T>`], a typed generational reference to one asset.
//! - Implements [`AssetManager`], the store holding every asset column.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A [`Resource`](crate::resource::Resource) holds one value per type, and code
//! fetches it by type through [`Res`](crate::query::Res). A mesh or a texture
//! is one of many values of the same type, so the type alone cannot name one.
//! Assets therefore get their own store instead of a second reading of
//! [`Resource`]. [`AssetManager`] is itself an ordinary resource, so
//! `Res<AssetManager>` and `ResMut<AssetManager>` reach it, and the scheduler
//! already keeps two systems from using it at once when their uses conflict.
//!
//! Storage works like component storage - one type-erased column per type in a
//! `TraitTypeMap` - without archetypes. Archetypes group entities by their set
//! of components, and that grouping means nothing for an asset.
//!
//! Each column is an `ErasedVecStorage` from `trait_type_map`. The operations
//! the column runs on its values are a table of function pointers that this
//! store owns, so loading new code can replace the table (see
//! [`AssetManager::rehome`]). Values and handle indices stay where they are
//! across that swap.
//!
//! A [`Handle<T>`] is generational. Freeing a slot adds one to that slot's
//! generation, so a handle kept across an unload returns `None` instead of
//! quietly naming whatever was loaded into the slot next.
