//! Registration bookkeeping: what each generation registers, and how a type
//! that no generation registers any more is dropped and forgotten.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Answers what this generation registers: the persistable type manifest
//!   and the sequence markers the host captures before a module's `init`.
//! - Enumerates what one `init` registered afterwards, by name and by id, so
//!   a type a reloaded module dropped is detected instead of orphaned.
//! - Forgets registrations whose owner is gone: drops their columns and
//!   releases their bits, keeping name-keyed entries only while a surviving
//!   registration still claims the name.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! After several reloads the registry can hold one entry per generation for
//! the same type name, each with its own `TypeId`, so the forget paths find
//! entries by name and retire every id they find. A bit is released only when
//! no archetype still maps it: an archetype's mask is also its id, so a bit
//! reused while live rows still reference it would make two component sets
//! share one column.
