//! Components the engine defines because more than one consumer needs them.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Defines [`TransformComponent`], an entity's placement in the scene.
//!   Rendering, physics, audio and gameplay code all read it.
//! - Declares its editor field layout and the one call that registers it
//!   ([`register_transform_component`]), so a world that uses it shows the
//!   transform's fields in the inspector.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The transform belongs to the scene rather than to a renderer: where a thing
//! is has nothing to do with a GPU. Renderer-specific mesh, camera and material
//! contracts live in the rendering crates, and a renderer that wants a
//! component of its own - a pixel position for a sprite, say - defines it
//! beside the code that draws it.
//!
//! The struct's bytes are a shared ABI. Another language binds the same row
//! through the name the component registers under and the `repr(C)` size it
//! checks. A `TypeId` would not work for this, because it is computed per
//! compilation unit; [`TransformComponent`] declares a shared name instead, so
//! every binary that registers it resolves to the same column. The component is
//! declared by hand rather than with `#[derive(PillComponent)]`, whose
//! inventory entry would make every artifact that links the engine register the
//! component - and add it to that artifact's persistable-schema fingerprint -
//! whether the artifact used it or not.

// External crates
// The derive macro for the field layout: the layout half of `PillComponent`,
// without the inventory entry that registers the type in every artifact.
