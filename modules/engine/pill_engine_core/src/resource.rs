//! Singleton resources stored in the [`World`], not attached to entities.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Defines the [`Resource`] marker trait for global/shared state types.
//! - Provides [`ResourceId`], which names a resource type and stays the same
//!   across artifacts when the type declares a shared name.
//! - Implements [`ResHandle`] - a lightweight, copyable handle for deferred resource access.
//! - Owns [`ErasedResource`], the storage one resource value lives in.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A resource holds global state: time, input, configuration, an asset store.
//! Systems reach it through `Res<T>` (read-only) and `ResMut<T>` (read and
//! write) parameters, and [`ResHandle<T>`] is a zero-cost typed handle that
//! can be stored and passed around without borrowing the [`World`].
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use pill_engine::*;
//! # let mut world = World::new();
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! struct ProjectTime { delta_seconds: f32, elapsed_seconds: f32 }
//! impl Resource for ProjectTime {}
//! world.insert_resource(ProjectTime { delta_seconds: 0.016, elapsed_seconds: 0.0 });
//!
//! // A handle is cheap and copyable.
//! let handle = ResHandle::<ProjectTime>::new();
//! let time = handle.get(&world).unwrap();
//!
//! // Systems take the same resource through Res/ResMut.
//! fn my_system(time: Res<ProjectTime>) {
//!     println!("Elapsed: {}", time.get().unwrap().elapsed_seconds);
//! }
//! ```
