//! Generic, type-erased component field access for editor-style tools.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Own the field vocabulary an inspector speaks: [`FieldValue`], the
//!   [`ComponentFieldError`] returned by every refused edit, and the helpers
//!   that name a field's kind (`is_handle_tag`, `is_entity_tag`,
//!   `is_container_tag`).
//! - Keep the module's public paths stable. [`FieldValue`] and
//!   [`ComponentFieldError`] are the names the rest of the engine uses, and
//!   [`MAX_EXPANDED_ELEMENTS`] and [`format_component_debug`] are re-exported
//!   from the files that own them.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Components live in erased columns, and nothing downcasts through `dyn Any`.
//! So the field layout that `#[derive(PillComponent)]` and
//! `#[derive(PillMirror)]` register (`name`, `type_tag`, `offset`, `size`,
//! `align`, `element_count`) is the only generic way to reach a component's
//! value. This module is the safe wrapper over that layout, split by concern:
//!
//! - `mod.rs` (here): the vocabulary, the errors and the tag helpers.
//! - `row.rs`: finds a component's field in a live row, then reads or writes
//!   it. Every entry point that resolves a live row looks the component up
//!   through **the entity's own archetype**. That archetype is the one place
//!   that records which generation created the data; a lookup by name across
//!   the whole registry can find several registrations under one name. No
//!   pointer into the row is handed to the caller.
//! - `codec.rs`: turns a row's bytes into a [`FieldValue`] and back.
//! - `expand.rs`: flattens a nested `struct:` field into leaf rows while a
//!   component registers.
//!
//! [`FieldValue`] covers the closed `type_tag` vocabulary of the derive. A
//! `struct:` field, or any other tag the engine cannot interpret, is read as
//! [`FieldValue::Opaque`] and is never edited by value, so an inspector can
//! show such a field instead of hiding it. A restore writes the captured
//! bytes back exactly as they were read. A nested `struct:` field whose type
//! has a known layout never appears as `Opaque`: the world flattens it into
//! dotted leaf rows at registration
//! ([`World::register_component_with_layout`]), so `Opaque` appears only when
//! no layout could be found.
//!
//! A tag is the derive's name for a field's type, not a type itself. `f32`,
//! `u64` and `bool` are scalars, `struct:Handle<Mesh>` is an asset reference,
//! `entity` is an entity reference, `array:<tag>` is a fixed array, and
//! `struct:<path>` is anything the engine cannot interpret. Reading a tag is
//! always a string comparison against this closed set, never a type lookup.
//!
//! # Row byte convention
//!
//! A row's bytes are native-endian. That includes an asset handle's two `u32`s
//! (index first, then generation) and an entity reference's slot and
//! generation. The C# mirror reads the same row in the same process, so no
//! byte order crosses a machine boundary. A field that ever does would need its
//! own convention stated here.

// Submodules split by concern: the row layer, the codec and the layout
// expansion done at registration. The two `pub use` lines keep the public
// paths of the items those files own.
