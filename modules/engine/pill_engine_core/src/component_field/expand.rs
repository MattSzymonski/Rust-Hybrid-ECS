//! Expansion of nested component field layouts at registration time.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Flatten a `struct:` or `array:struct:` field whose type has a known
//!   layout into dotted leaf rows - one per leaf, and one per array element -
//!   composing offsets as it descends.
//! - Keep the declared layout beside the flattened one, and own the resolver
//!   that tells a later registration what a nested type looks like.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Expanded field names are interned: expansion keeps one shared copy of each
//! distinct dotted name for the whole process and never frees it. A layout
//! stores its names as `&'static str`, so a later registration of the same
//! type reuses that copy instead of making a new one. A layout with nothing to
//! expand borrows the caller's `'static` slice instead, so only a real
//! expansion allocates.
