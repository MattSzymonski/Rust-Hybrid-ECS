//! Compile-time field layouts of components and value types.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declare [`ComponentFieldDescriptor`], the description of one component or
//!   value-type field. The derive macros emit it, the world keeps it for the
//!   editor, and the host reads it to generate the C# mirror.
//! - Declare [`FieldDecorator`], the presentation metadata a field declares
//!   for the editor's Inspector.
//! - Declare the [`ComponentLayout`] trait the derives implement, and
//!   [`ValueTypeLayoutResolver`], the function the world calls to find the
//!   layout of a value type that a component field nests.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The registries the derives submit into (`PillComponentDescriptor` and the
//! other descriptor types) live in `pill_engine`, the facade crate every
//! project and extension depends on, not here. The facade is compiled into
//! every DLL, so each DLL's registry holds exactly what that DLL declared.
//! This crate holds only the definitions that are the same for all of them.
