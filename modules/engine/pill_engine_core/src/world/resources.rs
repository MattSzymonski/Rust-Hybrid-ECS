//! Resource storage: registration, claims, foreign values and re-homing.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Stores one value per resource type, native or foreign, and hands it out
//!   through `Res<T>` and `ResMut<T>`.
//! - Decides which type owns a shared name when two binaries both declare it,
//!   so the second one reads the same value instead of creating its own.
//! - Re-homes a live resource's function table across a reload and retires the
//!   claims a retiring generation leaves behind.
//! - Declares the asset types a generation owns, and prunes the import registry
//!   once a retired generation's registrations are dead.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A resource is a singleton, so it has no archetype and no row. The store is a
//! map from id to a box that holds the value together with plain data about its
//! type: a drop function, size, alignment, an optional schema hash and a
//! foreign flag. That data is not a trait object's vtable. Component columns
//! work the same way and for the same reason: the table can be re-pointed at
//! the newest generation, so the destructor that runs always belongs to code
//! that is still mapped.
//!
//! A foreign resource is the same store with no Rust type behind it: plain
//! bytes plus a declared layout. That is what lets managed code own a resource
//! the host has never heard of.
