//! The world: the engine's central store of entities, archetypes, components
//! and resources.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declares the [`World`] struct: every map and counter the engine's state
//!   consists of, and the one place they are constructed.
//! - Creates and destroys entities, and hands their ids out again through a
//!   free list.
//! - Owns every archetype, including the migration that moves one entity's row
//!   from one archetype to another.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A component type has to be registered before it can be used, because the
//! world gives it a bit index that archetype masks are matched with. Destroying
//! an entity puts its id back on a free list with a new generation, so an old
//! handle cannot reach the slot's next occupant.
//!
//! `World` is the API most of the engine talks to, and it has several jobs:
//! script dispatch, resource claims and field reflection. Each job has a file
//! of its own below, and each of those files adds its own `impl World`. That
//! split exposes nothing new, because a child module's `impl World` is the same
//! implementation and can reach the struct's private fields.
