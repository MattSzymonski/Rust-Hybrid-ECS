//! Reflection and diagnostics: what the world can say about itself.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Answers the field-layout questions an editor asks: which fields a
//!   component or resource declares, and where each one sits in a row.
//! - Enumerates the world for a tool rather than for a system: the entities
//!   that exist, the component names attached to each, and which types are
//!   registered at all.
//! - Prints the archetype list, builds a Graphviz DOT description of the
//!   archetype graph, and estimates the world's memory for telemetry.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Most of these methods only read the world, and they identify components and
//! resources by name or id rather than by type, because the callers are tools
//! (the editor, the managed side) that never hold the Rust type. A name is
//! also the one identity that survives a reload: a tool keeps names between
//! generations and resolves the ids again in each new one.
