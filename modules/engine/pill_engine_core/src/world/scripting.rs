//! Script components: registration and per-frame dispatch.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Registers a component type that also carries an `update` method, and
//!   records the per-type updater that calls it.
//! - Runs every script component once per frame, through a context that defers
//!   structural changes to the command queue.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! A script component is an ordinary component first: it registers through the
//! same path as any other, and the script half is one table of updaters keyed by
//! component id. Each frame, dispatch asks the registry for the component's bit
//! instead of storing it, so a type that was removed and registered again on a
//! new bit is still found. Dispatch goes through a plain function pointer
//! rather than a trait object, so an updater must be a non-capturing function:
//! it cannot capture state and has no closure environment in which to keep the
//! raw pointers, or anything else, after the call. Registering a type twice
//! overwrites its entry, so it has one updater, not two.
//!
//! The updater receives raw pointers to the world and the command queue because
//! the dispatch loop already borrows the archetype storage it passes in, so it
//! cannot lend out `&mut World` at the same time. Each pointer is valid only
//! for the call that receives it.
