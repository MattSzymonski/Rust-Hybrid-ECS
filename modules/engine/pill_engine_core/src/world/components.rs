//! Component registration, storage access, and per-entity attachment.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Registers the three kinds of component type - a Rust type, a type shared
//!   between DLLs, and a layout described at runtime by a managed manifest -
//!   and keeps the storage description a reload replaces.
//! - Reshapes and re-homes live columns across a reload: a relayout rewrites a
//!   column's rows in a new shape, a remap moves them to a successor
//!   registration, and the re-homing pass points every column's function table
//!   at code that is still mapped.
//! - Reads and writes one entity's component, and adds or removes one, which
//!   moves the entity to a different archetype.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Registration is data, not code. A component's storage description is a
//! layout plus a table of function pointers, never a closure compiled into the
//! DLL that registered it. That is what lets a column outlive its DLL: the
//! table is replaced on reload instead of staying behind in the old image. The
//! three kinds differ only in what proves a row holds the right type - an exact
//! `TypeId`, an identity derived from a name, or a validated layout - and all
//! three use the same column type.
