//! Frame timing, maintained by the engine and readable from any system.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Defines [`Time`], the engine-owned clock resource.
//! - Tracks the time elapsed since startup, how long the previous frame took
//!   and how far this frame should advance the simulation.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! [`Time`] is inserted by [`Engine::new`](crate::engine::Engine::new) and
//! advanced at the top of every frame, before any system runs. Systems read it
//! through `Res<Time>`.
//!
//! [`Engine::process_frame`](crate::engine::Engine::process_frame) advances the
//! clock itself instead of running a registered system. A "time system" would
//! only run ahead of the systems that read the clock if every project
//! registered it first. The scheduler fills its parallel batches in
//! registration order (see [`ensure_execution_graph`](crate::scheduler::SystemScheduler::ensure_execution_graph)),
//! so a project that registered a time system late would leave the systems
//! before it reading the previous frame's values. Advancing the clock outside
//! the system set makes every system in a frame see the same values, whatever
//! order the systems were registered in.
