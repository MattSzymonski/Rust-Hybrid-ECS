//! The engine core: an archetype-based Entity Component System and everything
//! built on it.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Declares all public modules that compose the engine: world, queries,
//!   scheduler, assets, persistence, hot-patch machinery.
//! - Re-exports the public types at the crate root.
//! - Configures the Tracy profiled allocator when the `profiling-memory`
//!   feature is active.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Projects, extensions and the macros never name this crate directly. They
//! use `pill_engine`, a facade that re-exports everything here under the same
//! paths and adds the per-DLL `inventory` registries. This crate holds the
//! code every DLL shares, and never reads a registry: when it needs something
//! from one, the calling DLL passes it in. It must never depend on
//! `pill_engine`.
//!
//! The module ABI is **Rust-to-Rust by design**: a loaded project or module
//! receives an [`EngineApi`] with a pointer to the host's engine, and calls
//! the typed API through it. There is no language-neutral plugin table; see
//! [`api`] for why one would need a second copy of the whole API.

// The derive macros expand to `::pill_engine::...` paths, so this crate needs
// the name `pill_engine` in scope to use its own derives. `TransformComponent`
// derives `PillLayout` here rather than carrying hand-written offsets. Only
// `PillLayout` can be used here: the other derives submit into registries,
// which live in the facade.
