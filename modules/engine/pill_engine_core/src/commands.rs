//! Deferred command queue for structural ECS mutations.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Provides [`Commands`], the handle a system uses to queue structural edits
//!   without holding `&mut World`: creating and destroying entities, and
//!   adding and removing components.
//! - Implements the two-phase frame lifecycle: systems queue commands while
//!   they run, and the engine applies them after the last system finishes.
//! - Re-exports [`CommandError`], the failure a queued command reports when the
//!   flush cannot apply it.
//! - Provides [`DeferredEntityBuilder`], which collects the components of a new
//!   entity over several calls and then queues its creation.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Systems never mutate the world's structure directly. They queue, and the
//! flush that follows the last system applies each command:
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

//! ```
//!
//! Queuing instead of applying is what lets systems run in parallel without
//! locks. It also keeps an archetype's rows fixed while a query iterates them,
//! because no entity moves to another archetype before the flush.
//!
//! ## Usage Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use pill_engine::*;
//! # #[derive(Debug, Clone)] struct Health { current: f32 }
//! # impl Component for Health {}
//! fn combat_system(mut query: Query<(&Health, Entity)>, mut commands: Commands) {
//!     for (health, entity) in query.iter_mut() {
//!         if health.current <= 0.0 {
//!             // Queue for destruction - doesn't happen immediately!
//!             commands.destroy_entity(entity);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! // After all systems have run, the engine applies the queue and the dead
//! // entities are actually removed.
//! ```
