//! [`QueryTarget`] trait and built-in implementations for query data shapes.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Defines the [`QueryTarget`] trait that determines what data a query yields per row.
//! - Implements `QueryTarget` for `&T`, `&mut T`, [`Entity`], and tuples of these.
//! - Detects an aliasing target - two writes of one component, or a read beside
//!   a write - at construction time.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Each implementation reports the components it reads and the components it
//! writes. A query builds its component mask from that report, and a system
//! declares the same access to the scheduler. The mask and the declared access
//! then cannot disagree about what the target touches.
//!
//! An implementation also builds the state a query keeps for one archetype and
//! reads one row out of it by index. That state holds raw pointers into
//! component storage, so the parallel iterator can share it only when it is
//! `Send + Sync`.
