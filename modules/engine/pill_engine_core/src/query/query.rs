//! The [`Query`] entry point - holds an exclusive borrow of the [`World`]
//! and produces sequential or parallel iterators.
//!
//! # Responsibilities
//!
//! - Builds a query from a `&mut World` and caches the archetypes it matches.
//! - Builds a [`ComponentMask`] for the target and one mask pair per filter
//!   branch, so an archetype that cannot match is skipped.
//! - Delegates iteration to [`QueryIterMut`] (sequential) or [`ParQueryIter`]
//!   (parallel).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The query caches the ids of the archetypes it matches, together with the
//! world's archetype generation at the time of the scan. A later call to
//! [`iter_mut`](Query::iter_mut) reuses that list while the generation is
//! unchanged, and scans again only after archetypes were added or removed.
